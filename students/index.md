1. You?

I am continuously looking for good people to join my research group, at all levels: undergraduate students, M.S students, Ph.D. students, Postdocs, or research programmers.

Before getting in touch, read a [list of research topics](http://gustavopinto.github.io/research) that I am interested in. This list is not exhaustive, though. Students are welcome to bring their own research topic.
