Step 1: Install Xcode.

Step 2: Xcode no longer includes the command line tools by default. Go to Xcode preferences then Downloads and install the Command Line Tools.

Step 3: The command line tools no longer contain autoconf, which you'll need to build admb from source. I would install them using [homebrew]. First install [homebrew]. Then, in Terminal type `brew install automake`. `automake` includes `autoconf`.

Step 4: Download the admb source code. Get it from the [website][admb downloads] or download the latest svn code: [link and terminal code]

Step 5: Now we need to configure and make admb from source. By default admb seems to still[link] get the architecture wrong by default. So, we'll need to build with the 64 bit option specified. Couldn't find this anywhere in ./configure --help and couldn't get the flags correct myself. Found it [here][bolker newsgroup].

./configure BUILD_64BIT=yes

Step 6: In terminal: `make`

Step 7: In terminal: `make install`

Done.
