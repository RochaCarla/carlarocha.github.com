      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>While I’m starting my second year of Assistant professor, it is worth to look
back and see how was my first year. It may help to improve my professoring
skills or maybe help someone else who is just about to start his academic
career. In numbers, last year I taught five courses (all of them new to me),
supervised tree urop students, and co-supervised tree masters student and one
phd student. In terms of service, I reviewed 12 papers to four conferences and
journals. I also published nine research papers and submitted two research grants.</p>

<p>Let me distill this.</p>

<h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>

<p>I taught five courses in 2017, all of them for undergrad. My peers in the US
would consider this a very high workload, but I would say that this is the
normal workload in Brazil. In my department, in particular, no professor
teaches less than 4 courses per year. But a professor can teach as many as five
in a single semester. The exact number depends on some variables such as
the number of urop students or if the professor teaches grad courses. If the
value of the first variable is greater than 2 or if the second one is true, you
can teach the minimum number of courses in that given term (which is two).
One interesting thing in my university, which is quite common in other Brazilian
universities, is the fact that when you join an university as a professor, you
do not teach for grad school straight ahead. Instead, you should “apply” for
teaching in grad school. They do that to make sure only professors interested in
research are within the set of professors that teach grad courses. And your
permanence in this set depends if you are doing good work. Otherwise you are
out (of the grad school program) and should apply again. Important to say that you
can only supervise master or phd students if you are in a grad program. Not sure
if that makes much sense, but this is how things work over here. I applied in
the second semester and I can have master students this year (phd students only
after one master student graduate).</p>

<p>Getting back to the courses, I taught Algorithms,
Databases 101, Operating Systems (Lab), Advanced Data structure, and Advanced
Databases. All these courses were new to me. It took a lot of time to create
the material for these courses, and I still have say they are not great. The
problem was that I was not <em>that</em> excited with teaching. I like teaching but
my first semester workload was a kind of disappointing to me (I want to do
research and other things). I also have a hard time with one class of students
that were not motivated at all. This issue was completely new to me and I had
no idea on how to address it. I chatted with some colleagues and some of them
also reported the same felling. Last year I went to two educational-focused
software engineering conferences. I also discussed this matter over there, but
this time I went back with some possible solutions, which can be summarized in
PBL (Problem-based learning). The courses that I taught followed that traditional
lecture format (e.g., the professor talks, the students listen). Although
students have problems to work on, the most interesting ones were in
mid to the end of the course. Only later I realized that if a student is not
motivated from the beginning, it is not an interesting problem at the end of
the course that will change her mind.</p>

<p>Although I was very passionate about some of the topics, it was hard to
transmit such passion to students. One initiative that I’m willing to give
another shot is to <a href="http://gustavopinto.org/codefather/training-students-with-open-source-software/">bring open-source software projects inside the classroom</a>.
Generally speaking, the students really learned new skills and enjoyed the work.
There were also students that faced many barriers with Git and those that did not even try.
Students’ motivation is still one thing that I should learn more.</p>

<h2 id="advising">Advising</h2>

<p>Advising students is one of the most fun and interesting thing in this academic
career, I think. However, as I said, it was not straightforward to join in the
grad school program. Since I just get into it, one could think now I can have many
students. However, new professors are limited to one master student per year. They say
that because they do know how do the professor work. Only after the first
master student graduate is when you can have
as many as you want. Actually, up to three master students per year (department
rules). The good thing about this restriction is that it forced me to
look for collaborators. In 2017 I co-supervised four students (3 masters and
1 phd). Only one of them is a student at my university. 3/4 of these students
were fist authors in papers published last year. The one without paper has
one paper under submission and is currently working in another one. I believe
these are good results. I also advised three urop students. This group of
students was particularly interesting to me because I perceived that there are
many undergrad students that are as skilled as or even more skilled than
many master students. One particular urop student really impressed me and we may
submit her work to a good software engineering conference in 2018 (which
sometimes is hard to do with master students).</p>

<h2 id="research-and-service">Research and Service</h2>

<p>In 2017 I published nine papers. However, six of them are short papers. I have
to say that I was tempted to submitted that many short papers (some of them were
very old stuff that I’d pay to not touch in the data anymore). Still, I am
the first author of four papers (although two of them are remaining
unpublished parts of my phd). The other two papers pretty much reflect my lack
of students: short papers with little depth. Don’t get me wrong. Short papers are
good: the information is quickly transmitted and easily consumed. However,
publishing a lot of short papers is not a synonym of high quality research.
I plan to do less of it in 2018.</p>

<p>Finally, I reviewed 12 papers for four conferences. This is a low rate and I’d
like to improve it. However, I’ll only receive more invitations if I keep
publishing good work.</p>
