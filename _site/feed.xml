After thinking for a while in these questions, I perceived that they can be translated to a single question: “should I apply for this position at University X”. This question is obviously important, because the decision to go to University X instead of University Y can pretty much drive your PhD. For instance, if University X does not provide basic funding to cover your expenses, it would be much more difficult to finish a PhD. However, if funding is guaranteed, the decision should not be taken in terms of the place you are going, but instead with who you will be working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, it will be very impressive to state in your CV that you have a degree from that top notch university. These universities may also have beautiful labs, with a lot of funding for your research. You may also have family or close relatives that live in the city that you are planning to move, and this would greatly reduce the transaction cost. However, in my rather little experience, the most important factor is your advisor. What if your advisor is a very busy person, that needs to coordinate several projects, and several people? What if your advisor is not a very friendly person? What if your advisor is planning to do some startup and now does very little research?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: Is it worth to work in the top CS school in the world if you advisor is not available to support you accordingly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, for many kind of research works (at least in software engineering) you may not need a multi million dollar cluster neither thousands of dollars to travel for field study. That’s awesome if you have. But if you don’t, it is not the end of the work. You can also find some very interesting research topics that you can work on your 2013 notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IMO, More important than this is actually an advisor that could properly guide your work. That can devote some week hours to talk to you. That trust on you. That help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it may be very hard to note these qualities in a person that you may not even know in person. Next are some tips that may give a hint along these lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find his/her personal webpage&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the very first rule of thumb. If your prospective advisor does not have a webpage, he may be very, very busy. Important: webpages such as Google Scholar or DBLP are not personal webpages. The bare minimum personal webpage should clearly make available his/her email address. If one does not provide a way to others contact him/her, s/he may not want to receive your contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to his/her former students&lt;/strong&gt;: Former students are an excellent source of information. Perhaps no one knows better than them how their former advisor works and behaves. Important: many advisors made available a list of his/her former students. This list can be available on the advisor personal webpage, or on their CVs. Cold email a bunch of former students and ask their perceptions regarding work with your prospective advisor. Many former students will be glad to help (in particular if they enjoyed the time that they worked with your prospective advisor. Moreover, there is nothing wrong to ask for an insider opinion (your prospective advisor does the same when he asks for recommendation letters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow him/her in a social network&lt;/strong&gt;: As of today, Twitter is probably the de facto on line way that researchers broadly communicate with their peers. Obviously email plays a role. However, email is private and you can hardly interact with someone else who is already having a discussion. But you can do this on Twitter. If your prospective advisor has a Twitter account, follow him/her to get a glimpse about what he thinks about many things. Whenever possible, interact with him/her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for an Skype meeting&lt;/strong&gt;: A short online meeting can help a lot. If you have a negative answer, this may indicate a carelessness. Even very busy/famous professors can find the time for a quick online meeting. However, before the meeting, think about 3–5 question to ask the professor. Asking questions may indicate an interest on you side. If you have no interest, why should s/he have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gustavo Pinto</name><email>gpinto@ufpa.br</email><uri>http://www.gustavopinto.org</uri></author><summary type="html">Look for active internet users</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What I think about teaching</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/teaching-open-source-software/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What I think about teaching" /><published>2019-05-14T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2019-05-14T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/teaching-open-source-software</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/teaching-open-source-software/">&lt;p&gt;Although I am a professor, teaching is not the part of my work that I love the
most. I do like teaching, but I do not love teaching. And when I have a heavy
teaching working, I tend to enjoy it even less. Some reasons because teaching is
just OK to me: teaching (preparing material, teaching itself, grading, etc)
takes a lot of time; we have little to no feedback (students rarely comment if
the class was amazing or terrible); students are not always
engaged with the class, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried some approaches to try to improve students’ engagement, but this
blog post is not about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a student, I liked to participate in meetups and local conferences to
give talks. The act of be in the front of several people (probably more skilled
and experienced than me), teaching than something new, was vibrant to me.
I loved that feeling. As a consequence,
I tried my best to give a good presentation. I read books about how to give a talk.
I attend a course on how to speak in public. I practice the talk many, many times
before delivering the talk.  I liked not only giving the talk itself,
but the process to prepare the talk (working on the slides, thinking about the
best words, looking for good figures, etc). I could easily spent many hours working
on a single talk that I could deliver in 20 minutes or less. And this made completely
sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I am preparing the classes material, I tried my best to do that
as fast as possible. Not fast to the point to have a crap material, but also far
from having a perfect material. If I could grade my classes material, I may give
six or even five in a scale from zero to ten. It is true that I do not have the
same amount of free time available that I had when I as a student, so
obviously, I could not employ many hours to create the materials for a single class.
Then I could naively lie to myself thinking that my classes materials are not
great because I do not have the time to curate the materials. However, even if I
had the time, I believe I would not make much progress to improve its quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when it comes to delivering the lecture, there is a whole new figure.
I still enjoy a lot being in the front of a room explaining things, over and over again.
I try my best to give a good lecture. I try my best to show to student how
beautiful and exciting is one given concept. But that is it. After the lecture,
I still have to grade exams, create or improve the materials, prepare exercises,
and so on. And all of this is just boring to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was true till this semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semester I am teaching Open Source Software Development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source software is something that interest me a lot. During my early days
in my undergrad course, I was an intern in a local internet provider. This was
a very interesting experience, mainly because it was my first contact with Linux.
I learned a lot of bash programming using vi. I also learned to set up several
network services, and I became very interested in computer network stuff. Several
colleagues of mine went to grad school to study computer network, and I had no idea
how I became a software engineering guy. I started to use Linux at home (a Brazilian
distribution called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hardware.com.br/kurumin/&quot;&gt;Kurumin&lt;/a&gt;), and I also
volunteered to install Linux in several places (something that today is called
“Linux Install Fest”). I did my master in a school that was all about open source.
I remember that they were very proud to state everywhere that they only had a single
Windows machine because of a CAPES requirement. Other than that, it was all about
Linux. Even thought I was never an active contributor (although I have contributed
here and there), I enjoy that culture. I enjoy to participate in open source
events, to discuss about open source, and to spend an afternoon trying to install
one driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my PhD I moved focus a bit, and did not spent much time with open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my PhD, I became again involved with open source, but now on the
research side. The research works that I did with open source projects and
communities seemed to be more
aligned with the industry practice, which was something that I was very concerned about.
It suddently became my main research topic; the literature that I am more
familiar with. For me, it is easy to talk about open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was luck to have a colleague in my university that shares the same passion
about open source that I had. This colleague is not an open source researcher;
instead, he is an active open source hacker. He does the things that I study.
He has the practice that I describe in my research papers. The next logical step
was obviously to create this open source development course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience I had building this course was completely different than any other course
I created. First because I started to create the material many months before the
course. Second because I reread many of the fundamental books in this discipline
(e.g., the cathedral and the bazaar). Third because I look forward to the class.
Needless to say that I enjoy very much give the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be obvious to the reader, but it only became clear to me lately:
I like teaching this course because it is about something that I enjoy a lot.
I do enjoy learning about data structures or databases, but I do not have very interesting experiences
with them (other than using them to create ordinary software). I also do not do
research on these topics. I am also not that familiar with the fundamental books
nor the newest literature. I teach these courses because I have to teach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned? Try to teach the subject that you like the most. If
that is not possible, try to expand your research interests to cover the
disciplines that you are teaching.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gustavo Pinto</name><email>gpinto@ufpa.br</email><uri>http://www.gustavopinto.org</uri></author><summary type="html">and how to enjoy it more</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why blogging in academia is important</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/why-blogging-is-important/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why blogging in academia is important" /><published>2019-04-29T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2019-04-29T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/why-blogging-is-important</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/why-blogging-is-important/">&lt;p&gt;Researchers are busy people. We always have many things to do, and we often
delay in delivering our projects. How many times did you receive an email that
started with “sorry for this late response”, or perhaps an email that was not
even answered? This behavior is so normal in academia that we do not think this
is strange anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are so deeply involved in our projects, we have little to no time to
take care of side projects that may not lead you to that tenure that you often
dream about. More concretely, if the project does not help a researcher to improve her metrics,
such as number of citations or number of publications, chances are that this
project may be delayed, or even abandoned. This is why blogging in academia is
so hard. Because blogging will not help you to get tenure, to get that paper
accepted, or to help your research be funded. On the contrary, blog will take
away that precious time that you could invest in things that will, indeed, improve
your performance counters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, blogging in academia is extremely important. Think about that researcher
that you admire the work she does. How cool would be if she would write blog
posts describing the process that she use to find new ideas, or how she hire students,&lt;br /&gt;
or how to deal with their problems, what she does to recover from paper deadlines,
what she thinks about conferences, journals, etc. When you blog, you let people
know more about not only your work, but also you. These conversations are, however,
natural in conferences. But if you blog, you help someone that does not have
funding to attend a conference. When you blog, you also spread your voice to
many more people than you could reach in a conference. Think you as a young
student. How amazing it would be to see yourself facing the same problems
(or perhaps conceiving the same ideas) that a well known researcher,
with many more years of experience, in that top university, also face. We are
all human, we all face problems. But blogging makes it transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging is also a tech transfer channel. Since blog posts are shorter than most
academic research papers, readers can read all your blog posts in a small amount
of time, and then could get a much better perception about the kind of work you
like to do. None of this could be accomplished  with research papers solely (OK, you
can learn about ones work while reading his papers, but it would take much,
much  more time). Blogging can also spread your findings faster. Say, instead
of sharing your beautiful research paper with practitioners, why don’t you write
a blog post summarizing the key findings, and share these findings (in a much
better format) with them? Blogging can also help you to improve your writing
skills, which is particularly valuable for those (like me) who are not from
English speaking countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paradox: I know that blogging is important and I do really want to blog more.
However, blogging tasks a good amount of time that I could use to work or to stay
with my family. &lt;strong&gt;To keep blogging, however,, I made a deal with myself: I will not revise any of
my blog posts&lt;/strong&gt;. That is, after I am done with what I consider the first draft,
I will post it immediately. I took
this decision because revising and editing could take as much as or even more time
than the first draft itself. For instance, if I need one hour to write one blog post, it would actually
mean two hours, at least: one for writing, one for revising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware that many
posts here have typos and strange wording. But I believe it is better to have
blog posts with writing issues rather than no blog post. Although not polished,
I think these blog posts serve their proposes: which is to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gustavo Pinto</name><email>gpinto@ufpa.br</email><uri>http://www.gustavopinto.org</uri></author><summary type="html">or why these posts have typos?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Changing roles in the academic system</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/changing-roles-academic-system/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Changing roles in the academic system" /><published>2019-04-11T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2019-04-11T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/changing-roles-academic-system</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/changing-roles-academic-system/">&lt;p&gt;I have been reflecting on the roles that I took in academia over these last 10+
years and I finally decided to write them down. I believe I have passed through at
least four different roles in the academic system. These roles are informal and
they only exist in my mind. I may have spent 3–4 years in
each role. The roles follow a very sequential process: you only pass to the
next one when you pretty much understand the current one. Interestingly, there
is no one that says that you should pass thought all these roles, in this order.
They just happen to happen to be like this. At least it happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roles are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding what is research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning how to do research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conceiving research questions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping other to do research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I worked in several tech companies during my undergraduate studies,
I did not have an opportunity to experience research.
Therefore, I only started to scratch the research world in my masters. I started
my masters in 2008 and finished in 2010, so I that I played my first academic
role (&lt;strong&gt;understanding what is research&lt;/strong&gt;) during this time window. In this particular
role, my main obligation was to understand what research is all about. Since I had zero
research experience, but reasonable industry experience, I had that feeling that
research as about creating software (eg, if I create a software that does X, I
would be able to graduate). I remember my former advisor telling me that I should
work on something that the industry is not yet doing (and not doing the same thing
that industry was doing). I also remember that it was quite difficult to understand
what she meant by this (doing a thing that this great company is not doing? what?
how could this be even possible?). By that time, my comprehension about research
improved, but was still opaque. The problem that I worked during my masters was
also a kind of challenge-free, so I knew that if I could implement the stuff that
I was supposed to implement, I was good to go. For me, research was a lot of work
and little to no reward. In this sense, research was pretty much what I  experienced
in industry, not to mention the hassle of being a student with little income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished my masters in 2010 with this rough notion of research, and still in
2010 I get back to the industry. I nevertheless started my phd one year later,
in 2011. I have to say that I started my phd still trying to understand what is
research. I eventually figured out that research is about understanding the unknown.
It is not about creating software solely, but to create software to test hypothesis.
I do not remember how I sorted this out, but I believe it was due to the fact
that my phd advisor often asked me to do more than one research work. These works
were done in collaboration with other students and professors, and were targeting
different research topics. All of this contribute to build my research understanding.
The next logical step was to &lt;strong&gt;learn how to do research&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not to say that
I did not do research in my master. I did. However, I did not have the conscious
understanding that what I did was research. For me, it was all about engineering.
Moreover, I have to say that it was a lot of effort to understand how to do research.
Although I have published some papers here and there in the first two years of my
phd (most of them in collaboration with other students, as aforementioned), my
phd thesis was pretty much empty. My first paper related to my thesis was accepted
only in my third year. Why was that? Because it took me a really while to find a
problem. My advisor was really open about anything, but I was in charge of looking
for interesting problems to find answers to. This process of conceiving problems
turned out to be incredibly difficult. During the first 1–2 months, you dedicate
yourself to read the literature, and you figure out that you do not know anything.
After many other months of intense reading, you start to comprehend the landscape
of one very particular part of the literature. At this moment, it seems that every
interesting question already had an answer. It seems that every interesting piece
of work that worth doing is already done. This lack of comprehension of “what to
do next” is a symptom of this second role: I understood what research was about, but
I did not know how to do it. The solution now is clear: I have to ask new questions.
Ask a new question is easy. Ask a good new question is hard. Ask an unique question
is harder. Ask an unique question that could give you a phd title is even harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually I ended up with some research questions during my phd (some of them
borrowed from the literature, some other stated my by former advisor, etc), but
I believe I only started to understand how to &lt;strong&gt;conceive research questions&lt;/strong&gt;
after my phd. We can go to a bar and some hours after come back with a list of
research questions. But how do you know which one will not lead you to a dead end?
Or how do you know that this research question was not already asked in that bedrock
paper from the 80s? How do you know reviewers will care about this research question?
Will readers care about this research question 10 years from now? Will you care
to finish a research paper that has this particular research question? There are
many other questions related to the importance of the research question. And to
conceive good research questions, you should care about these other questions.
Every single time. One may say: “yo, I can write a paper without thinking too
much about research questions”. Yes, of course you can do. In particular if you
are working on a subject that you know a lot (you know the open questions). You
can also read the “future work” section of the most important papers in your area
to easily grasp other research questions. However, one key aspect of conceiving
research questions is to find something that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; would love to do. More
importantly, regardless if the question is unique, unanswered, timely, beautiful,
etc., would you trade your precious time to find an answer to it? It is not about
finishing a masters or a phd. It is about doing work that matter (at least to you).
Ultimately: look for question that keep your eyes open, day and night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the last role, which is the one that I am pursuing now, I believe, is
about &lt;strong&gt;teaching other to do research&lt;/strong&gt;. The goal now is not to have your paper
accepted at that top conference, but, instead, helping others to have their papers
accepted as well. Since I am just starting this role, I have little to share. But
one thing that I am thinking is that: since these roles last for about 3–4 years
each, which role comes next?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gustavo Pinto</name><email>gpinto@ufpa.br</email><uri>http://www.gustavopinto.org</uri></author><summary type="html">from student to scholar and more</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to send a student to attend ICSE (with zero budget)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/how-to-sent-a-student-to-icse/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to send a student to attend ICSE (with zero budget)" /><published>2019-03-31T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2019-03-31T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/how-to-sent-a-student-to-icse</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/how-to-sent-a-student-to-icse/">&lt;p&gt;This year, an undergraduate student of mine first-authored a paper in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/msr2019c.pdf&quot;&gt;MSR
challenge track&lt;/a&gt; on the
presence of violations in JavaScript code snippets available on StackOverflow.
This blog post is an attempt to summarize all the steps taken to find a way
to send the student to attend the conference (and present his paper). Perhaps
it could help some other students to make it to ICSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, my student applied to four sources of funding: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-Student-Volunteers&quot;&gt;student volunteers&lt;/a&gt;, the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-Software-Engineering-Mentoring-Workshop&quot;&gt;Software Engineering Mentoring Workshop (SMeW)&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sigsoft.org/resources/caps.html&quot;&gt;CAPS SIGSOFT&lt;/a&gt; grant, and an internal grant in my
university. I will detail each one of them next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, the student volunteer program happens every single year in
ICSE (and also happens in several other software engineering conferences, such as
ICSME and ASE). In ICSE, an accepted student volunteer receives a free registration
for the main conference, but could also be scheduled to work in the co-located
events (granting one-two more registration days). Therefore, applying for student
volunteer greatly reduces one of the most costly part of attending a conference:
the conference registration. Besides of it, students volunteers also have an unique
opportunity to meet senior researchers that run the student volunteer program,
and also other students (which could ended up in new research opportunities).
I myself participated as a student volunteer in three conferences (2 OOPSLAs and
one ICSE); I could not recommend more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this year there is the Software Engineering Mentoring Workshop. This
workshop is intended to “attract students to research careers in software engineering”.
I believe this was the first time that this workshop happened in ICSE, although
similar workshops happen on regular basis on programming language conferences
(e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pldi19.sigplan.org/home/PLMW-PLDI-2019&quot;&gt;PLMW&lt;/a&gt;). My student applied
for this grant and received CAD 500,00 plus one day ICSE registration. But since
he received a free ICSE registration for his work as a student volunteer, this
one day registration was not used. Now he had enough for registration and hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he had a MSR paper, and was accepted for the mentoring workshop, he applied
for the CAPS funding. CAPS offer support for students and professionals that need
additional funding to attend SIGSOFT conferences. I have applied to this grant in
the past, but since I had received no response for my application, I thought that
this grant was not working. But I suggest my student to apply to it nevertheless.
I also discussed this matter on twitter (read thread &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/1104505538732351490&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and Thomas Zimmermann, SIGSOFT Chair, responded that he would take care of the
CAPS program. Turns our that my student received USD 400,00 from CAPS (about 50%
of what he asked for). Although this amount does not fully cover a round trip
ticket from Belém to Montreal, it amortizes a good proportion of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I applied for him in an internal travel grant that my university runs
for undergraduate students. The amount was fixed in around USD 330. Although
this is a very particular grant from my university, I am aware that other
Brazilian universities provide similar mechanism to help students. Now his trip
is fully covered (including eventual meals, ground transportation, travel
insurance, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrapping up, I am glad that there are many international grants aimed to
help students to attend software engineering conferences. But the trick thing is:
if one of these grants does not have a positive outcome, I would have to complement
his trip out of my own pocket (although I have a small grant running, I could not
use this grant to support his trip; I will leave this explanation for another blog post).
If his application was not accepted in two or more grants, his trip would become
extremely prohibitive. Still, these grants have different application dates
(and, consequently, notification dates). So eventually the student find himself in a
position such as: (1) what if I accept this grant but did not receive the other one?
(2) Could I say “yes” for a grant but eventually say “no” to it due to the lack of
additional support? (3) should I start making reservations, or should I leave it
to the last minute (when tickets often become more expensive)?
These questions are all valid and tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn out that the stars in the sky were well aligned the applications were all
positive. Reflection upon this endeavour, maybe it would be interesting if all
these programs would have close notification dates to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final tip: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-ACM-Student-Research#Call-for-Contributions&quot;&gt;ACM Student Research Competition&lt;/a&gt; also rewards the students with accepted papers
with up to USD 500,00 to help them defray their travel costs. My student did not
submit to ACM SRC (I may have forgotten; this blog post can help even myself in
the future).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gustavo Pinto</name><email>gpinto@ufpa.br</email><uri>http://www.gustavopinto.org</uri></author><summary type="html">Apply for every single opportunity (and cross your fingers)</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Characterizing the Roles of Contributors in Scientific OSS Projects</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/characterizing-the-roles-of-contributors-in-scientific-oss-projects/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Characterizing the Roles of Contributors in Scientific OSS Projects" /><published>2019-03-05T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2019-03-05T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/characterizing-the-roles-of-contributors-in-scientific-oss-projects</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/characterizing-the-roles-of-contributors-in-scientific-oss-projects/">&lt;p&gt;Recently some colleagues and I have been trying to understand the roles of contributors in open source scientific software projects. We studied 7 well-known scientific software projects that were hosted on GitHub (including &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Chaste/Chaste&quot;&gt;Chaste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/&quot;&gt;Khmer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/genn-team/genn&quot;&gt;Genn&lt;/a&gt;). For each selected project, we identified the roles played by different contributors by analyzing each projects’ documentation, websites, and other readily available sources. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative data, we curate some findings that we believe are interesting for the broad Medium population. Here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senior researchers tend to be the most active and prolific contributors in terms of commits and file creation.&lt;/strong&gt; In four of the seven projects we studied, faculty and staff contributors were responsible for half or more of commits made to the project (with an average commit share of 72%). In five projects, senior members were also responsible for the majority of files created and, by that measure, the resulting project structure. This influence over the overall direction of the software project was also evident in the fact that senior researchers were the most likely to have interacted with files related to the build system, project metadata, and developer documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Junior contributors, especially graduate students, are critical drivers of new features as well as supporting activities like test creation.&lt;/strong&gt; On average, junior contributors were responsible for 42% of commits across all projects we studied; in one case, juniors were responsible for nearly 100% of all commit activity. The majority of these commits came from graduate students, who had the longest contribution periods among juniors (with 1.72 years of commit activity compared to 0.98 years for postdocs and 4 months for undergraduates). Similar to senior contributors, junior contributors are significantly involved in creating new features, improving existing capabilities, and fixing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An open-source model facilitates external contributions, but the results are mixed.&lt;/strong&gt; On one hand, an open- source model makes it easier to attract third parties to help grow and maintain the software. However, the software is also made for and by members of a relatively niche and intensely preoccupied community. In the majority of projects we studied, third party contributors tended to be domain expert users who were only active for one day. We also note, however, that these same contributors are more likely to offer defect-correcting commits, which is highly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como escrevi no último post, ainda estou começando minha carreira de pesquisador,
mas se tem uma coisa que é, no mínimo, irritante é essa discussão sobre Qualis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nas reuniões que participo no programa de pós graduação da minha universidade,
esse tema é recorrente. Como é o único programa que eu participo, e como é a primeira
vez que participo, algumas coisas pra mim são novidades (não necessáriamente
interessantes). Por exemplo, inscrições para doutorado são feitas em fluxo contínuo,
e a avaliação dos candidatos é feita durante a reunião da pós, pelo colegiado.
Ou seja, não tem um grupo de trabalho que avalia as propostas. Basicamente quem
esteve presente na reunião tem direito de opinar no candidato. O edital é claro
com relação aos requisitos mínimos que o candidato deve preencher para entrar no
programa. No entanto, mesmo atendendo os requisitos, os documentos do candidato é
discutido (?!). Um tópico recorrente na discussão é que o candidato tem &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; artigos
Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. Ou que tem em submissão um arquivo Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. Ou qualquer coisa
Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. O interessante é que a discussão é feita por membros do colegiado que
são de áreas diferentes, avaliando um pedido de inscrição de um candidato que pode
nem ser da área dos membros presentes. O numero de Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; dirige a discussão.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nas reuniões do programa também se avalia pedidos de defesa (?!). Da mesma forma,
se discute se o aluno tem &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; artigos Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. Nas discussões de qualificação,
trancamento, etc.. tamém se discute o Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;. Eu inclusive (!) já presenciei
discussões em bancas em que os membros discutem o famoso Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;, não para fins
de (talvez) avaliar o que foi feito, mas, pior, para dirigir o que ainda precisa
ser feito (“para o aluno graduar, ainda é necessário &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; artigos Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essa discussão é infinita. E não leva a lugar nenhum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primeiro, o que quero dizer com &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; artigos Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;? Que o aluno tem,
supostamente, bom domínio do problema? Boa capacidade de pesquisa? Liderança?
Inovação? Perseverança? Não. Nada disso. O &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; artigos Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; apenas diz que
o aluno conseguiu publicar artigos que são mapeado pelo Qualis (basicamente qualquer um). Isso é bom? Não
necessáriamente. Isso é ruim? Não necessáriamente. Há alguns conferências/revistas boas
com má avaliação no Qualis, mas, pior ainda, há também várias conferências/revistas ruins bem
avaliadas no Qualis. E se o aluno tem &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; artigos Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; em revistas predatórias?
“Ah”, (alguém pode dizer) “mas basta algum membro do comitê perceber isso e comentar
a respeito”. No entanto, como disse anteriormente, muitas das discussões sobre o
Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; que já participei são feitas por membros avaliando trabalhos de fora
da sua área de atuação. Logo, uma possível resposta para a pergunta acima (o que
se quer dizer com &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; artigos Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;?), é que o aluno sabe jogar com as regras
do jogo. O triste é que as “regas do jogo” estão culturalmente enraizadas e
espalhadas como um cancer (ou você nunca ouviu alguem falando do &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; artigos
Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; do fulano?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por algum motivo, ao longo do meu doutorado, eu era um leitor avido do blog do
professor &lt;a href=&quot;http://matt.might.net/&quot;&gt;Matt Might&lt;/a&gt; (se você não conhece, seja o blog
ou a história do prof. Might, pare de ler agora, e vá conhecer). Um dos seus posts,
inclusive, viralizou na internet, o &lt;a href=&quot;The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.&quot;&gt;The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;.
Nesse post, o prof. Might conseguiu, de uma incrivelmente simples, ilustrar qual
o propósito de realizar um doutorado (ou uma pesquisa, de maneira mais ampla).
De acordo com ele, o motivo é &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;avançar as fronteiras do conhecimento&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Simples assim.
Perceba que não há menção nenhuma a artigos, revistas, muito menos (bleh) Qualis.
Avançar o conhecimento é o que deveria dirigir o interesse em possuir uma vida na
academia. Trazer luz ao desconhecido.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alguém pode perguntar: “mas um artigo Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; não poderia também avançar o
conhecimento?”. Sim, poderia (mas não necessáriamente). O problema não é ter artigos
ter &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; artigos Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; publicados (o prof. Might mesmo tem vários; eu também
tenho).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O que &lt;em&gt;drive me nuts&lt;/em&gt; é tomar decisão baseada no Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O que &lt;em&gt;drive me nuts&lt;/em&gt; é discutir trabalho alheiro baseado no Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O que &lt;em&gt;drive me nuts&lt;/em&gt; é delimitar uma tese de doutorado baseado no Qualis &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eu sei que é muito difícil desassociar o Qualis da vida acadêmica. O ponto não é
esse. O ponto é discutir a produção dos pares por meio da contribuição científica,
e não por mesquinharias como Qualis X. Como mesmo o prof. Might colocou em &lt;a href=&quot;http://matt.might.net/articles/tenure/&quot;&gt;outro
post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life is too precious and too fleeting to waste my time on bullshit like tenure. I didn’t become a professor to get tenure. I became a professor to make the world better through science. From this day forward, I will spend my time on problems and solutions that will matter. I will make a difference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apenas pare com essa discussão sobre Qualis. Pare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Por fim: se você é novo em uma área e quer saber quais são os locais mais interessantes
para dedicar seu tempo e esforço, esqueça o Qualis. Olhe para plataformas como o
&lt;a href=&quot;http://csindexbr.org/&quot;&gt;CSIndexBr&lt;/a&gt;, veja quais são as conferências/revistas indexadas,
e gaste seu tempo somente nesses locais.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gustavo Pinto</name><email>gpinto@ufpa.br</email><uri>http://www.gustavopinto.org</uri></author><summary type="html">Isso é irritante</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Second year of professoring</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/second-year-of-professoring/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Second year of professoring" /><published>2018-12-28T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2018-12-28T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/second-year-of-professoring</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/second-year-of-professoring/">&lt;p&gt;Following my blog post about my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gustavopinto.org/blog/first-year-of-professoring/&quot;&gt;first year of professoring&lt;/a&gt;, in this blog we
update the status for the current year. Let me revisit this wonderful year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teaching&quot;&gt;Teaching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I taught four courses this year, all of them to undergrad. This is the minimum
number of courses one professor can teach in a year in my university (the only
exception are professors that accumulate administrative roles, which is not
my case). I taught Databases 101, Advanced databases, Advanced Data structure,
and Object Oriented Programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing about these courses is that the
first three of them I have already taught last year, so I employed less time to
create the course materials (I only had to update them). The exception was the
Object Oriented Programming, which I have to start from scratch. I was heavily
inspired by the methodology used in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFfxcOHnowQ&quot;&gt;on line course&lt;/a&gt;, made by Eduardo Guerra, who
teaches unit testing in the very second day, and use it throughout the course.
While I found it very interesting, looking back to the course, I believe students
did not find it very pleasant, and very few of them really mastered unit testing.
Part of it is, of course, my fault. I am still learning how to be a professor;
this is the first time I taught this course; and unit testing is, I believe, not
something very easy to teach. I noted that, in particular, during some of the
class assignments, which I already provided the test cases, the interfaces, and
asked students to create the concrete classes and fill up the method bodies.
Later on I unfortunately perceived that very few students really made it. Some
students were have basic issues with the Java programming language (even though
they learnt C before Java), and the use of more advanced features of an IDE (such
as debugging) did not help much them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other classes I think went more smoothly.
However, the Advanced databases course is heavily based on database theories (e.g.,
concurrency, atomicity, storage, etc), and students have a hard time trying to
connect the dots between the theory and practice. In one particular assignment,
I asked students to build a very large dataset using (1) a binary file and (2) a
real database, and try to do some queries. The result of this assignment was
quite interesting, since students perceived that a full-fledged database often
perform worse than simple queries made over a binary file. During the Databases 101,
I asked students to play with the MSR dataset. I was surprised by some of the works
that students did; two of them in particular could be very competitive research papers,
if polished and enhanced here and there. The lesson I learnt from this course is
that I can take advantage undergrad students to do some good research work. However,
it also requires much more time from you (e.g., Besides advising, I spent many
hours dealing with the MSR dataset. I have to build the dataset twice, because
the machine that I was using to build the dataset was not robust enough. I also
have to add more physical memory to it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advising&quot;&gt;Advising&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I started to advise one more master student (two in total), and I advised
seven undergrad students over their capstone projects. Three of the undergrad
graduated (two just graduated last week, and the other one graduated last semester).
I am particularly proud of the work that one undergrad did. This particular undergrad
was having a hard time to graduate (I think he was in school for 7–8 years, maybe more).
With some help from my collaborators, we were able to send his work to ICSE SEET,
which was gladly accepted. (In the last year blog post I mentioned that I was
impressed by this student and we potentially would submit his work to a good software
engineering conference.. things worked well) In this year, my first PhD (co-supervised) student
graduated, and I also co-supervised a master student. Overall, I am really happy
for the work that they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the bad thing about advising: somehow, I ended up with students working in
many different research topics. Nearly, no research topic is close to the other,
so students could hardly collaborate. Another issue is that this approach requires
me much more cognitive effort. For instance, during a weekly meeting, I have to
load from my deep thoughts where we were in the last week, just to get back on track
(it is not “plug-and-play”). Besides that, I feel I’m not very familiar with the
related literature of all these kind of works, so then I cannot suggest good papers
to students and, even worse, the students may be working on something that is not
entirely novel. This is not to mention the need of 1–1 meeting (which could easily
drain all my agenda). As I perceive now, students should collaborate with each
other, and individual research topics should be parts of a more robust research
problem. I may need some time to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;research-and-service&quot;&gt;Research and Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I published 16 research papers (4 journals [SPE, EMSE, IST, and
JBCS], 10 conferences [ICSE: 2x, MSR: 2x, SBES: 2x, EASE, ESEM, OSS, SANER], 2
workshops [CHASE, VEM]). This year was by far the most productive one (in terms of
papers acceptance). Although I did not measure work hours, I suspect that this year
I spent less time on research than any other year (I have classes to teach, meetings,
a lot of service, other university commitments, etc). I also had my second kid,
which does not permit me to work from home anymore. This number of paper is, actually,
the collective effort of many collaborators. I myself was the first author of only
five papers. One thing that I’m particularly happy about these papers, is that
only two of them (the CHASE paper, and the IST paper) are short ones. Last year
I complained that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of my contributions were short papers, and that I planned
to avoid short papers in 2018. It seemed to work well. This year I also started
to curate my &lt;a href=&quot;http://gustavopinto.org/cv-of-failures/&quot;&gt;CV of failures&lt;/a&gt; (I have 19 submissions rejected in this year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing is that this year I did not travel
to any international conference. I have been traveling to conferences, meetings, whatever,
for so many years (I had that most frequent flyer badge in two different air companies).
It requires a lot from you. A lot of money (perhaps public money, but it is not always
the case), but, more importantly, it requires a lot of time. Being away from home
while traveling so much is not the best way to enjoy two kids. For 2019, I also
plan to fly less and less. This in turn requires me not to submit to/attend conferences.
One thing that I thought is that by not attending conferences, I may ended up with
less collaborators. Fortunately, this did not happen to me (yet?). What I can
anticipate is that you might see myself less and less in international conferences
in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in this work I reviewed a ton. I was invited to 24 PCs for 2018 conferences,
and I already participated in four PCs for 2019 conferences. I also reviewed seven
papers for journals [EMSE: 4, TSE: 1, SCP: 1, JBCS: 1]. I basically accepted any
invitation I received. Overall, I reviewed 53 papers, and wrote 30K words in reviews.
I am happy for all this work done, but … it was a lot. Let’s say I need 30 minutes
to write 500 words plus one hour to read the paper (a very conservative measure).
It would take me 68 hours (more than one week and a half) devoted only to review papers.
I cannot commit myself to all this work again in 2019. I hope you could understand
this when I turn down invitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gustavo Pinto</name><email>gpinto@ufpa.br</email><uri>http://www.gustavopinto.org</uri></author><summary type="html">Second year of professoring</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How do Scientists Develop Software</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/how-do-scientists-develop-software/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How do Scientists Develop Software" /><published>2018-02-26T00:00:00-03:00</published><updated>2018-02-26T00:00:00-03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/how-do-scientists-develop-software</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/how-do-scientists-develop-software/">&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of the paper “&lt;a href=&quot;http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/saner-rene2018.pdf&quot;&gt;How Do Scientists Develop Scientific Software? An External Replication&lt;/a&gt;”. As the name suggests, we conducted an external replication (different authors in a different context) of a well-known paper about &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.software-carpentry.org/training-course/2012/08/hannay-survey-2009.pdf&quot;&gt;how scientists develop and use software&lt;/a&gt;. The original paper was published in 2009, and given the recent changes in the software development practices in the last few years (e.g., the introduction of social coding websites and the prevalence of on-line learning platforms) and unique challenges of scientific research (e.g., the frequent and unforeseen changes in requirements and the need for both highly specialized domain knowledge and programming expertise), we believe that we should update our understanding about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original study, the authors conducted an on-line survey with 2,000 scientists. In our replication, we surveyed 1,574 R developers. One might argue that not all R developers are indeed scientists. We concur. To mitigate this threat, in our invitation email we kindly asked R developers that do not consider themselves as scientists not to answer the questionnaire. We also asked them not to share the questionnaire with their peers, since some of them might not be scientists as well. We also mined their R repositories to complement some of the findings. For instance, the following figure shows the number of projects with commits in the master branch over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/R-projects.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table compares the main findings of the two studies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original  Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replication Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;96.9% of the respondents state that informal self study is important or very important for developing scientific software (60.1% state that informal learning from peers is important or very important). Only 34.4% state that formal education at an educational institution is important or very important.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;99% of the respondents agree that self-study was important or very important (60% suggested that learning from peers is important or very important). However, 35% of the respondents believe that formal education is important or very important.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The importance of graduate studies is clearly greater than undergraduate studies. This, in turn, is clearly greater than that of high school studies. Formal training at work was considered as important or very important for only 13.1%.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Similarly, most of the respondents believe that graduate studies (72%) and their last five years at work (76%) were important or very important to learn what they know about software development. Our respondents also perceived High school (61%) and over the last 15 years at work (51%) as not important or not important at all.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;84.3% of the responses state that developing scientific software is important or very important for their own research. 46.4% state that developing scientific software is important or very important for the research of others&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;86% of the respondents believe that scientific software is important or very important to their own research. However, 63% of our respondents stated that developing software for the research of others is important or very important.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;On average, scientist spend approximately 30% of their work time developing scientific software.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;On average, our respondents spent 30% of their working hours developing software per week (min: 0%, 1st quartile: 10%, median: 20%, max: 100%, std dev: 23.73%&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;53.5% of the respondents state that they spend more or much more time developing scientific software than they did 10 years ago (44.7% spend more or much more time than they did 5 years ago and 14.5% spend more or much more time than they did 1 year ago.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;82% of the respondents believe that they spend ‘‘much more time’’ or ‘‘more time’’ developing software than 10 years ago; 72% when compared to the last five years. Over the last decade, there is also an increase in activity, in terms of commits, in the studied projects.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Scientific software is either used by a very large number of people (more than 5,000 users) or by a very small number of people (less than three).&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Our respondents work mostly alone (53% of the respondents develop software alone) or in small teams (another 42% develop software within a team of two to five). At maximum, we found 723 stars and 139 forks in the analyzed projects&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;The level of importance that scientists assigned to a software engineering concepts is mostly consistent with their understanding of this concept. Except for ‘‘software testing’’ and ‘‘software verification’’ scientists assigned a higher level of importance to these concepts than they judged understand.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Generally speaking, we observed that the respondents judged they knew less about the concepts of what they believe are important. A Chi-Square test confirmed that the scientist knowledge depends from what they judge important.&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;There is no consistent trend of association that links an increase of project or team size to perceived importance of software engineering concepts.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;After performed the ANOVA test, we could not reject the null hypothesis that project and team size influences the respondent’s perceptions about the software engineering concepts, once all p-values were higher than 0.05.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of the paper “&lt;a href=&quot;http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse2018.pdf&quot;&gt;Almost There: A Study on Quasi-Contributors in Open-Source Software Projects&lt;/a&gt;”. Quasi-contributor is a contributor that tried to contribute to open-source software but did not succeed, i.e., the pull-request was not accepted, for any reason. For the impatient, there is a summary of the summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quasi-contributors are rather common&lt;/strong&gt;. They are about 70% the number of actual-contributors. In some projects, there are more quasi-contributors than actual contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many reasons for non-acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;. Quasi-contributors believe there is a lack of communication, commitment, and experience. Integrators agree with quasi-contributors that not needed pull-requests are among the most common cause for nonacceptance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/3 of Quasi-contributors disagree with nonacceptance&lt;/strong&gt;. 32% of the quasi-contributors do not agree with the decision of not having their contribution accepted — for 19% of quasi-contributors that did not concur also felt demotivated or prevented to place additional contributions. 12% of the quasi-contributors reported that the feedback from the code review was not constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is a need of workforce to drive open source projects, many developers, newcomers to a project, send contributions which are not incorporated into the source code and give up trying. To better understand quasi-contributors and their rejected contributions, we mined data and metadata of 21 well-known, nontrivial, and popular OSS projects. We also surveyed 335 quasi-contributors and 21 project integrators (maintainers that are in charge of integrating changes proposed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observed that quasi-contributors are rater common. In three projects analyzed (angular.js, bootstrap, rails), there are more than 1,000 quasi-contributors in each one of them. In five out of the 21 projects, there are more quasi-contributors than actual ones. In some cases, the number of quasi-contributors is significantly higher: for instance, project bootstrap, has 2.3x more quasi-contributors than actual ones (it has 1,962 quasi-contributors and 844 contributors). On average, there are 480.9 quasi-contributors per project. Regarding the number of attempts, on average, a quasi-contributor tried  1.22 times (85% of the quasi-contributors tried only once). On the other side of the distribution, however, we found some quasi-contributors that tried really hard, but still did not succeed. In the bootstrap project, one quasi-contributor proposed 13 unaccepted pull-requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted a survey with quasi-contributors, and they mentioned several reasons for why the pull-request proposed was not accepted. The most common reason is &lt;strong&gt;superseded/duplicated&lt;/strong&gt; pull-request (e.g., “Other pull-requests fixed the same issues as my pull-requests”). &lt;strong&gt;Mismatch between developer’s and team’s vision/opinion&lt;/strong&gt; is also common (e.g., “when you add a new feature to the project, your vision can be out of tune with the vision of the project’s team, and this is natural”). We also observed a &lt;strong&gt;lack of interest from integrators&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g. “It was ignored maybe because it was a very minor fix”). We also asked integrators about the reasons for non-acceptance. According to them, the most common reason for nonacceptance is &lt;strong&gt;PR not needed/not relevant&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., “[such contribution] solves the immediate/local problem but does not address the deeper systemic issue”). The second most common reason is &lt;strong&gt;Guidelines not followed&lt;/strong&gt;. According to one integrator, such guidelines can range from “coding style, lack of tests, or messy versioning history”. Interestingly, none of the integrators assumed the mea culpa, i.e., the &lt;strong&gt;lack of interest from integrators&lt;/strong&gt; aforementioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the quasi-contributors surveyed agreed with the decision of having the pull-request unmerged (67.4%) and that the comments were constructive (88.8%). However, the number of unmerged pull-requests, the 30.3% of the developers that reported demotivation, and the 32.6% that reported disagreement with the community decision are not negligible. Moreover, 99 quasi-contributors did not agree with the pull-request nonacceptance, and 62.6% of them (62) answered that this fact demotivated or prevented them from placing another pull-request.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Gustavo Pinto</name><email>gpinto@ufpa.br</email><uri>http://www.gustavopinto.org</uri></author><summary type="html">A summary of an ICSE'18 paper</summary></entry></feed>
