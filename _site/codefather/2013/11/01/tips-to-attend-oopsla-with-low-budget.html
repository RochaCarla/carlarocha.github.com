<div id="content">
<p>Are you a [under]grad student who is wondering how amazing it could be to attend a top-tier conference such as OOPSLA, but you have a low budget? If so, I may have some tips to share with you.</p>

<p>In this year (2013) I attend my very first OOPSLA. It was awesome. <a href="https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/394562681253810176">I</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/395050744291659776">shared</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/395210719022436352">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/395683470971641856">histories</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/396020564361371648">on</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/396021132479827969">twitter</a>. However, one of the things that made it so great was because I don&rsquo;t needed to pay anything. Nor my advisor.</p>

<p>How I did it?</p>

<p>I basically follow these three steps: (i) submit a paper to ACM SRC, (ii) apply to be a student volunteer, and (iii) request PAC funding.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll briefly describe these steps here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Consider submit a paper on ACM SRC: One good reason to go to a conference is to present a previous  accepted paper (usually on the main track of the conference). In this case, you can request money from your advisor/university. But, if you are on the early stages of your research, or if you have already submitted to the main track and got rejected, you can also consider submit to the ACM SRC track. The goal of the ACM SRC is to facilitate interaction with researchers and industry practitioners, providing both sides with the opportunity to learn of ongoing current research. Additionally, the ACM SRC gives students experience with both formal presentations and evaluations. Another attractive interest to submit in this track is because you can receive up to $ 500 to spend in your trip.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply to be a student volunteer: When you are a student volunteer, you don&rsquo;t need to pay your registration. You could also eventually receive other interesting things, such as a costumed t-shirt, an invitation to a fancy dinner, and, of course, met  great people. On the other hand, you have to work during the conference. Some kind of works include: help in the registration process, help inside the rooms, or help speakers/attends to find their rooms. But, don&rsquo;t worry. You will find time to enjoy the conference.</p></li>
<li><p>Request PAC funding: Finally, if you have a paper accepted in one conference sponsored by SGIPLAN, you can also request funding from PAC. Note that not all conferences are sponsored by SIGPLAN. The ACM SRC, for example, is not sponsored. On the other hand, the Poster section is sponsored. These two tracks are held in Splash. Also, if you don&rsquo;t have any paper published, but was accepted to be a student volunteer, you can also request PAC funding.  It is pretty easy. You just have to fill up one form, saying how do you plan to spend this money. I met one guy that received more than $ 1,600 in PAC funding. So, regardless in which country do you live, just this amount of money can help you a lot to attend the conference.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So, these were my tips.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m not sure if you can follow these steps if you are planing to attend other top-tier conference. It works for OOPSLA.</p>

<p>That is it. I hope to see you next year on Portland in 2014 :)</p>
