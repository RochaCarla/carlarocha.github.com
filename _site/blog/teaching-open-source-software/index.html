      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        <p>Although I am a professor, teaching is not the part of my work that I love the
most. I do like teaching, but I do not love teaching. And when I have a heavy
teaching working, I tend to enjoy it even less. Some reasons because teaching is
just OK to me: teaching (preparing material, teaching itself, grading, etc)
takes a lot of time; we have little to no feedback (students rarely comment if
the class was amazing or terrible); students are not always
engaged with the class, etc.</p>

<p>I have tried some approaches to try to improve students’ engagement, but this
blog post is not about this.</p>

<p>When I was a student, I liked to participate in meetups and local conferences to
give talks. The act of be in the front of several people (probably more skilled
and experienced than me), teaching than something new, was vibrant to me.
I loved that feeling. As a consequence,
I tried my best to give a good presentation. I read books about how to give a talk.
I attend a course on how to speak in public. I practice the talk many, many times
before delivering the talk.  I liked not only giving the talk itself,
but the process to prepare the talk (working on the slides, thinking about the
best words, looking for good figures, etc). I could easily spent many hours working
on a single talk that I could deliver in 20 minutes or less. And this made completely
sense to me.</p>

<p>However, when I am preparing the classes material, I tried my best to do that
as fast as possible. Not fast to the point to have a crap material, but also far
from having a perfect material. If I could grade my classes material, I may give
six or even five in a scale from zero to ten. It is true that I do not have the
same amount of free time available that I had when I as a student, so
obviously, I could not employ many hours to create the materials for a single class.
Then I could naively lie to myself thinking that my classes materials are not
great because I do not have the time to curate the materials. However, even if I
had the time, I believe I would not make much progress to improve its quality.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to delivering the lecture, there is a whole new figure.
I still enjoy a lot being in the front of a room explaining things, over and over again.
I try my best to give a good lecture. I try my best to show to student how
beautiful and exciting is one given concept. But that is it. After the lecture,
I still have to grade exams, create or improve the materials, prepare exercises,
and so on. And all of this is just boring to me.</p>

<p>And that was true till this semester.</p>

<p>This semester I am teaching Open Source Software Development.</p>

<p>Open source software is something that interest me a lot. During my early days
in my undergrad course, I was an intern in a local internet provider. This was
a very interesting experience, mainly because it was my first contact with Linux.
I learned a lot of bash programming using vi. I also learned to set up several
network services, and I became very interested in computer network stuff. Several
colleagues of mine went to grad school to study computer network, and I had no idea
how I became a software engineering guy. I started to use Linux at home (a Brazilian
distribution called <a href="https://www.hardware.com.br/kurumin/">Kurumin</a>), and I also
volunteered to install Linux in several places (something that today is called
“Linux Install Fest”). I did my master in a school that was all about open source.
I remember that they were very proud to state everywhere that they only had a single
Windows machine because of a CAPES requirement. Other than that, it was all about
Linux. Even thought I was never an active contributor (although I have contributed
here and there), I enjoy that culture. I enjoy to participate in open source
events, to discuss about open source, and to spend an afternoon trying to install
one driver.</p>

<p>During my PhD I moved focus a bit, and did not spent much time with open source.</p>

<p>After my PhD, I became again involved with open source, but now on the
research side. The research works that I did with open source projects and
communities seemed to be more
aligned with the industry practice, which was something that I was very concerned about.
It suddently became my main research topic; the literature that I am more
familiar with. For me, it is easy to talk about open source.</p>

<p>I was luck to have a colleague in my university that shares the same passion
about open source that I had. This colleague is not an open source researcher;
instead, he is an active open source hacker. He does the things that I study.
He has the practice that I describe in my research papers. The next logical step
was obviously to create this open source development course.</p>

<p>The experience I had building this course was completely different than any other course
I created. First because I started to create the material many months before the
course. Second because I reread many of the fundamental books in this discipline
(e.g., the cathedral and the bazaar). Third because I look forward to the class.
Needless to say that I enjoy very much give the lecture.</p>

<p>This might be obvious to the reader, but it only became clear to me lately:
I like teaching this course because it is about something that I enjoy a lot.
I do enjoy learning about data structures or databases, but I do not have very interesting experiences
with them (other than using them to create ordinary software). I also do not do
research on these topics. I am also not that familiar with the fundamental books
nor the newest literature. I teach these courses because I have to teach.</p>

<p>Lesson learned? Try to teach the subject that you like the most. If
that is not possible, try to expand your research interests to cover the
disciplines that you are teaching.</p>
