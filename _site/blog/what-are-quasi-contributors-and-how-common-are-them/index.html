Quasi-contributors is a contributor that tried to contribute to open-source software but did not succeed to a given open source project (for any reason). For the impatient, there is a summary of the summary:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Quasi-contributors are rather common</strong>. They are about 70% the number of actual-contributors. In some projects, there are more quasi-contributors than actual contributors.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>There are many reasons for non-acceptance</strong>. There is also a lack of communication, commitment, and experience. Integrators agree with quasi-contributors that not needed pull-requests are among the most common cause for nonacceptance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>1/3 of Quasi-contributors disagree with nonacceptance</strong>. 32% of the quasi-contributors do not agree with the decision of not having their contribution accepted — for 19% of quasi-contributors that did not concur also felt demotivated or prevented to place additional contributions. 12% of the quasi-contributors reported that the feedback from the code review was not constructive.</p> </li> </ol> <p>–</p> <p>Although there is a need of workforce to drive open source projects, many developers, newcomers to a project, send contributions which are not incorporated into the source code and give up trying. We mined data and metadata of 21 well-known, nontrivial, and popular OSS projects. We observed that quasi-contributors are rater common. In three projects analyzed (angular.js, bootstrap, rails), there are more than 1,000 quasi-contributors in each one of them. In five out of the 21 projects, there are more quasi-contributors than actual ones. In some cases, the number of quasi-contributors is significantly higher: for instance, project bootstrap, has 2.3x more quasi-contributors than actual ones (it has 1,962 quasi-contributors and 844 contributors). On average, there are 480.9 quasi-contributors per project. Regarding the number of attempts, on average, a quasi-contributor tried 1.22 times (85% of the quasi-contributors tried only once). On the other side of the distribution, however, we found some quasi-contributors that tried really hard, but still did not succeed. In the bootstrap project, one quasi-contributor proposed 13 unaccepted pull-requests.</p> <p>We conducted a survey with quasi-contributors, and they mentioned several reasons for why the pull-request proposed was not accepted. The most common reason is <strong>superseded/duplicated</strong> pull-request (e.g., “Other pull-requests fixed the same issues as my pull-requests”). <strong>Mismatch between developer’s and team’s vision/opinion</strong> is also common (e.g., “when you add a new feature to the project, your vision can be out of tune with the vision of the project’s team, and this is natural”). We also observed a <strong>lack of interest from integrators</strong> (e.g. “It was ignored maybe because it was a very minor fix”). We also asked integrators about the reasons for non-acceptance. According to them, the most common reason for nonacceptance is <strong>PR not needed/not relevant</strong> (e.g., “[such contribution] solves the immediate/local problem but does not address the deeper systemic issue”). The second most common reason is <strong>Guidelines not followed</strong>. According to one integrator, such guidelines can range from “coding style, lack of tests, or messy versioning history”. Interestingly, none of the integrators assumed the mea culpa, i.e., the <strong>lack of interest from integrators</strong> aforementioned.</p> <p>Most of the quasi-contributors surveyed agreed with the decision of having the pull-request unmerged (67.4%) and that the comments were constructive (88.8%). However, the number of unmerged pull-requests, the 30.3% of the developers that reported demotivation, and the 32.6% that reported disagreement with the community decision are not negligible. Moreover, 99 quasi-contributors did not agree with the pull-request nonacceptance, and 62.6% of them (62) answered that this fact demotivated or prevented them from placing another pull-request.</p> <aside class="share"> <p>If you liked this article and think others should read it, please <a href="http://twitter.com/share?text=What are quasi-contributors and how common are them?&amp;url=http://localhost:4000/blog/what-are-quasi-contributors-and-how-common-are-them/&amp;via=gustavopinto" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'twitter-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">share it on Twitter <i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#00aced"></i></a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/blog/what-are-quasi-contributors-and-how-common-are-them/" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'facebook-share', 'width=550,height=235');return false;">Facebook <i class="fa fa-facebook-square" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#3b5998"></i></a>.</p> </aside> </div> </article> <aside id="comments" class="disqus"> <div class="container"> <h3><i class="icon icon-comments-o"></i> Comments</h3> <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script type="text/javascript"> var disqus_shortname = 'gustavopinto'; var disqus_identifier = '/blog/what-are-quasi-contributors-and-how-common-are-them'; var disqus_title = 'What are quasi-contributors and how common are them?'; var disqus_url = 'http://localhost:4000'; /*var disqus_developer = 1;*/ (function() { var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true; dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq); })(); </script> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a> </noscript> </div> </aside> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">&lt;/&gt; <a href="http://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace" title="a minimalist Jekyll theme for technical writing">Thinkspace theme</a> by <a href="http://heiswayi.github.io">Heiswayi Nrird</a>. | <i class="fa fa-copyright"></i> 2018 Gustavo Pinto</small> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>
