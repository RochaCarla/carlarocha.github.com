<p><a href="https://medium.com/@gustavopinto/1-5-good-habits-for-young-scholars-9d11c8ca2410">I wrote a short book in 20 hours.</a></p>

<p>Is this the best book I could write? No.</p>

<p>It this book really well-written? No.</p>

<p>Are you proud of this book? Definitely yes.</p>

<h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2>

<p>I am in the middle of a pandemic that is only getting worse. I have two small kids at home that require a lot of me. I only have the evenings free when they are already sleeping. I wrote for four evenings, about 2–4 hours every evening. I started writing on Thursday and finished on Sunday. Also, on Sunday I made the cover. On Monday morning, I started selling. I sell eight copies in the first day ($ 5 each).</p>

<h2 id="why-i-wrote-this-book">Why I wrote this book?</h2>

<p>Many reasons motivated me to write this book.</p>

<p>First of all, I have been thinking about writing a book for many years. I actually already started to write one book in the past, but I gave up not much later. <a href="https://medium.com/@gustavopinto/new-book-demystifying-open-source-licensing-52b977091718">For those that follow me on twitter, they may know that I am writing another book on open source licensing.</a> But I thought I need another book to be ready sooner.</p>

<p>Second, because I am in the middle of a pandemic, and I am feeling incapable of doing anything useful. I have already canceled some research works because neither my students nor I can commit to them anymore (<a href="https://medium.com/@gustavopinto/got-tenure-what-does-it-mean-e0afa94e1bc6">yes, I know I’m privileged</a>). Many relatives, friends, and colleagues are suffering from this pandemic, and I can barely do anything to help them. I like my work, but I don’t see my work being anyhow useful to help them overcome this immediate situation. Nevertheless, I’m seeing many colleagues who are finding a way to help others, for instance, <a href="http://ccsl.ufpa.br/covid-19/">by creating tools that could increase the pandemic awareness</a>. I eventually made some donations here and there, but, unfortunately, I cannot commit to these regular donations next month without compromising my family budget. Then I had the idea of writing a book and donating 100% of the sales to help COVID-19. My little experience <a href="https://medium.com/@gustavopinto/new-book-demystifying-open-source-licensing-52b977091718">pre-selling the other book</a> opened my eyes that it’s possible to sell books on Twitter.</p>

<p>Third, having this plan in mind, the last point was to decide what I could write about (and very quickly). It did not take much to realize that I could write about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/gustavopinto/caminhos-e-desafios-para-a-pesquisa-em-computacao-ou-como-se-manter-produtivo-na-regiao-norte">one of the talks that I gave in the past</a>. First because I believe the talk was well-received (both in-person and <a href="https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/1202323018762117120?s=20">on-line</a>). Second, because I was already thinking about putting the ideas of that talk in a blog post. However, I knew it would require me many hours to do it, so I was keeping postponing. By converting this blog post in a book motivated me to make it happen. And really fast.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-write-it">How did I write it?</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, I did not have much time to write this book. I decided to write the book on Thursday, April 23rd, and I was willing to compromise to make it available on Monday, 27th.</p>

<p>My first step was to find a book template. In my <a href="https://medium.com/@gustavopinto/new-book-demystifying-open-source-licensing-52b977091718">other book</a>, I have already spent some good hours fighting with a template (and I still don’t like my current template). To write the other book, I’m using asciidoctor, a framework that exports documents to many writing formats. To save some hours, for this book, I decided to use LaTeX instead. I’m reasonably familiar with LaTeX, so I would not wast any time configuring it, running it, etc. I also knew there are some excellent LaTeX templates out there, so it was not hard to find a one I liked.</p>

<p>Since this book was about a talk I gave in the past, I have the structure already designed in my mind. I used the same structure of the talk to structure the book. On the first evening, I wrote the preface, and the first two chapters (around 2.5k words). The preface I rewrote in the end, but I did not make substantial changes in the first two chapters after my first pass. I kept the same progress over Friday and Saturday (about 2k words per day). The book was 90% on Saturday. On Sunday, I made an overall pass, trying to fixing some typos and strange wordings. Also, on Sunday, I made the cover (using canva.com), and I wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@gustavopinto/1-5-good-habits-for-young-scholars-9d11c8ca2410">a blog post to share the book on social networks</a>. I already shared this blog post on hackernews and reddit on Sunday evening. On Monday morning, I wrote some tweets to release the book to the public. I made eight sales on the first day on Twitter and no sales through the other mediums.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-20-hours">More than 20 hours</h2>

<p>Although the title of this blog post is correct, upon reflection, I spent many more hours working on this book.</p>

<p>First, because I probably spent 20 hours or so designing and creating the talk. When thinking about the talk, I took several notes, made some sketches, and also did some research. After that, I spent some good hours creating the talk on Keynote. Till minutes before the talk, I was making changes in the slides. I also spent 2–3 hours rehearsing the talk, which gave me additional ideas. When writing this book, I took for granted the time I spent thinking about and creating the talk.</p>

<p>Second, because I also took for granted what I learned in the past. For instance, I did not have to do much research on the topic (it was fresh on my mind), and I did not need to master the tools used (it took 10 minutes to have a book template and about 30 minutes to have a cover).</p>

<p>It would be a different story I had to write about a subject that I am not super comfortable with.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s also important to notice that, as a researcher, a good proportion of my job is devoted to writing. I have been writing a lot over the last 10 years lot, so I’m used to technical writing. I’m not a fluent writer (I am not fluent in English either), but writing is not a big issue to me.</p>
