After many failed attempts, this post by Ted Kulp helped me solve all the
remaining issues to getting Dropbox and incron to work together to automate
Jekyll posting. Save a file in Dropbox and the website updates. Fantastic. Kudos also to [Tyler Hall's post][tylerpost], which got me most of the way there.
