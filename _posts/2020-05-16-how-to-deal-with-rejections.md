Yesterday I made an [YouTube live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQuiA_FoKHw) about how to deal with rejections (in PT-BR, sorry). This blog post is a text version of that video.

One important thing about rejections is that they are part of the academic process. Chances are that every researcher you may know have already receive one (perhaps many) rejections letters. Despite their well-known presence, we don't talk about rejections often. Different than, say, a soccer game, in which we know who own and who lose the match, in the academic game, we only know about the ones that have the paper accepted, the grants funded, the awards received, etc.

This might create an illusion that successful researchers, for instance, the ones that are invited to give talks, the ones that made the most fundamental contributions in your field, the ones who the names are often found in the academic literature, are the ones that never (or very infrequently) face a rejection. This is hardly to be the case.

Nowadays, in the academic game, the competition to get a paper published or to receive a grant is so fierce that, for any good conference or journal, authors are more likely to have a paper rejected than a paper accepted (regardless if your paper is good or bad). In the Software Engineering field, the one that I know a bit more about, the acceptance rate is often around 25%--30%. This means that, sometimes that only different between an accepted paper and a rejected paper is that we don't talk about the rejected one. And since we don't talk about rejections, they become harder to digest.

Knowing these problems, some researchers started to advertise their own rejected work. For instance, [Jessica Vitak](https://jessicavitak.com/) created the idea of "CV of failures" (not sure if she created, but hers CV was the first one I found). Opposed to a traditional CVs, in a CV of failures you highlight the things that you did not achieve.  That is, a paper not published, a grant not received, a job not offered, etc. I got inspired by her CV of failure, and I also [created mine](/cv-of-failures). By doing so, I think it became easier to me to talk about rejections. I can also make fun of it. While other are celebrating that they have a paper accepted in a given conference (something that is very common on my Twitter feed), I can also celebrate that [it's time to update my CV of failure](https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/1003685173924388864).

This CV of failure is very simple, though; it only lists a number of things that I did not achieve. Moving one step further, it may be interesting to provide more context about the rejected work. My former Ph.D. advisor [wrote an amazing blog post](https://fernandocastor.github.io/general/2016/10/11/long-hard-road.html) in which he distilled the entire process of having paper accepted, which was a journey paved with many of rejections. Even when we though that the paper was 99% accepted (after the second round of reviews in a journal in which *two* of the reviewers had already accepted the work), the paper was rejected. I remember that this rejection came close to Christmas Eve, in which I was alone (with this rejection letter).

Sometimes having a paper rejected hurts. Sometimes the notification arrives in a moment that we are not felling well (or perhaps in the middle of a pandemic). Sometimes a rejection may also limit our own professional future (it may be intimidating to apply for that faculty position while your papers are not yet published). I remember when I was doing my PhD that I was in the end of the third year/starting the fourth year and I didn't have any publications. How could I graduate if I have any publications? I did have some drafts, but the drafts could not impress the committee (even if the different between the draft and a paper is just the acceptance letter). How could I follow an academic career if I don't have papers accepted?

To discuss a bit more about these uncertainties, in the video I made a quick pass in this [research paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691619898848), which I cannot recommend enough. This paper is a summary about a panel about "Repeated Rejection, Impostor Syndrome, and Burnout" that happened in a Psychology conference. The paper reports stories about researchers that have been dealing with this subject over the years, as well as coping strategies. One of the excerpts that I found really helpful is:

"There is value is knowing that other academics get rejected, experience impostor syndrome, and feel burned out. There is value in simply knowing that **you are not alone**."

That is, since other researchers rarely talk about rejections, we might believe that only our work is rejected. One of the researchers that share her rejections, mentioned that she submitted 45 unique manuscripts a total of 160 times, and approximately 75 of them were desk rejected. She also mentioned that some of her researcher papers took seven years to be published, and many research papers were published in the 5th or 6th attempt. Nevertheless, she also mentioned that these papers are the ones that she like the most. I could relate here. The paper that my former advisor wrote about is also one that I like a lot.
