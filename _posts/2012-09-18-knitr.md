[Luis Apiolaza](http://www.quantumforest.com/2012/08/mid-august-flotsam/) tipped me off to this fantastics series of posts by Jeromy Anglim on [Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/). I like where Knitr is going. Whereas Sweave always seemed a bit heavy handed for most analyses, Knitr is lighter, has less syntax, and lends itself to generating more than old-school LaTeX PDFs.
