Alright. I'm convinced. Good writing is essential to academic success. More accurately, good writing is essential to most forms of *life* success. Many bright people say it takes a lot of practice to get good at something and writing is no different. And so, here I am starting a new version of seananderson.ca. A version where I am encouraged to write.

The version of seananderson.ca you see today came about after at least four complete redesigns that never saw the live internet. It's time to stick with something. After all, the content, and in particular the act of content creation, is what matters.

Designing a site based on static-site generator has long been a line on my todo list. Working with [jekyll.rb] was simpler than I expected. Jekyll fits my needs perfectly --- it has the right blend of simplicity, control, and scriptability; the friction to posting and modification is minimal; and I agree with the philosophy of Jekyll.
