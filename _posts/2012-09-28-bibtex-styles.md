title: Ecology BibTeX Style Files
subtitle: A collection of BibTeX style files for ecology journals.

I posted some [BibTeX style files] to GitHub. I generated these files over the years using the custom-bib LaTeX package. Where I could find my copy of the .dbj file I have included it as well. You can make modifications to the .dbj file and re-run them to create modified .bst files.

I haven't tested these style files extensively, but they met my needs writing manuscripts for these journals. They have mostly been tested with journal articles, technical reports, and books.

So far, I have posted styles for these journals:

- [BioScience](https://github.com/seananderson/bst/blob/master/bioscience.bst)
- [Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences](https://github.com/seananderson/bst/blob/master/cjfas.bst)
- [ICES Journal of Marine Science](https://github.com/seananderson/bst/blob/master/icesjms.bst)
- [Journal of Crustacean Biology](https://github.com/seananderson/bst/blob/master/jcrustbiol.bst)
- [Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://github.com/seananderson/bst/blob/master/mee.bst)
- [Trends in Ecology and Evolution](https://github.com/seananderson/bst/blob/master/tree.bst)

If I can save one person from having to answer another ~99 questions from makebst.tex, posting these will be a success.

We could use a better repository of existing .bst files.
