My love for this keyboard is unholy.

For the first time in over 10 years, my wrists don't hurt when I type. I'm not sure why I put up with this for so long, besides that I didn't know it could be better. 

I was already using the Microsoft Natural 4000 keyboard. It helped a fair bit. It made it possible to work, but it would still hurt when I worked a lot.

The strangest part that I'd never thought about was the subtle psychological element to always feeling pain when you've finished working. It's a subtle source of discouragement to work.

The adaption was less smooth that I'd hoped. I'd read all the reviews. People claimed it would take about two weeks before you'd be back to your original typing speed. I didn't believe it. It's very true. Not because of the funky concave dome of keys. You get used to that pretty quickly. You also get used to the delete key and enter key being at your thumbs pretty quickly (and this is one of the least heralded but nicest advances to this keyboard). It's all the arrow keys and brackets that get moved around. I'm still getting used to that. So my speed while coding is still slow. My speed at typing normal prose has certainly risen higher than it ever was with a flat keyboard and I feel no frustration.

One of the weirdest feelings, which I wasn't expecting is what it feels like to use a normal keyboard after using the Advantage for a while. Flat keyboards feel *convex*. A very weird feeling, but one that quickly goes away.

I have continued to type regularly on my MacBook Air keyboard (although it starts to hurt quickly). I can transition back and form with ease.

I stopped using my MS 4000 keyboard cold turkey. I'm a total klutz if I try it now. It takes the opposite approach --- make the keys extra wide and curve them around a convex shape. The narrower concave shape of the Advantage makes the MS 4000 seem like a gigantic keyboard where your fingers just can't reach far enough to hit keys. And the keys. Oh the keys. The Advantage has beautiful mechanical key switches that are a pleasure to type on.
