Hi, I'm **Carla Rocha**.

I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Faculty of Software Engineer](http://fga.unb.br) of the [University of Bras√≠lia (UnB)](http://www.unb.br/), Brazil, and one of the coordinators of the research group [LAPPIS](https://github.com/lappis-unb). 

I am also one of the founders of the mentorship program to introduce underrepresented groups to contribute to Open Source community, the Big Open Source Siblings ([BOSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bAOZ0gLjEIwOLhkRhakvaXG1_FP4fGuHYMVhEc72w7M/edit?usp=sharing)).

I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including DevOps, Agile, human aspects of software development, and open source software. I have coordinated several applied research projects in collaboration with both government agencies and private companies. In these projects, I coordinate the development of open source solutions, applying DevOps/MLOps best practices/automation, and innovative experiments. I had more than 50 scholarship students under my supervision participating in these projects.

You can see my list of publications, along with ***all*** preprints. 

Are you a student looking for an advisor? Are you a researcher and think that our interests overlap? I'm always looking for collaborations; you can reach me at caguiar<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@unb.br.
