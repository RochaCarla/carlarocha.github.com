Hi, I'm **Gustavo Pinto**.

I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Faculty of Computing](http://www.computacao.ufpa.br/) of the [Federal University of Pará](http://www.ufpa.br/), Brazil. I do research in the broad area of software engineering. I teach programming at the BSc level. I (eventually) [blog](http://gustavopinto.org/blog/) and do [talks](https://speakerdeck.com/gustavopinto).

I received my Ph.D. from [Federal University of Pernambuco](http://cin.ufpe.br), Brazil, under [Dr. Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor) supervision. During the academic year of 2013-2014, I was a visiting scholar at the [State University of New York](http://binghamton.edu), working with [Dr. Yu David Liu](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~davidl). My [Ph.D. thesis](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/thesis.pdf) was all about software energy consumption. I wrote a summary of my PhD thesis [here](/phd-summary).

<!-- From December 2015 to March 2017 I have been an Assistant Professor at the [Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Pará](http://www.ifpa.edu.br/), Brazil. Before becoming a professor, I did a Post Doc also with [Dr. Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor).-->

Nowadays, my broader interests include energy consumption (*e.g.*, [CACM'2017](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/cacm2017.pdf)), concurrent programming (*e.g.*, [OOPSLA'2014](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/oopsla2014.pdf)), human aspects of software development (*e.g.*, [SANER'2016](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/saner2016.pdf)), and mining software repositories (*e.g.*, [ICSE'2018](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse2018.pdf)). You can see my list of [publications here](/publications), along with ***all*** preprints. I also maintain my [cv of failure](/cv-of-failures).

I am currently the (co-)Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development ([JSERD](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jserd/)).

Are you a [student looking for an advisor](/students)? Are you a researcher and think that our interests overlap? I'm always looking for collaboration; you can reach me at gpinto<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@ufpa.br.
