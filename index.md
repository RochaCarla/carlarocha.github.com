I am an Assistant Professor at the [Faculty of Software Engineer](http://fga.unb.br) at the [University of Bras√≠lia (UnB)](http://www.unb.br/), where I also serve as one of the coordinators of the [LAPPIS](https://lappis-unb.github.io/lappis.rocks/) research group. I have a diverse range of interests in Software Engineering, including DevOps, Agile, human aspects of software development, Machine Learning, and Open Source software.

Additionally, I am a co-founder of the Big Open Source Siblings([BOSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bAOZ0gLjEIwOLhkRhakvaXG1_FP4fGuHYMVhEc72w7M/edit?usp=sharing)), a mentorship program aimed at introducing underrepresented groups to Open Source contribution. Through my research projects in collaboration with government agencies and private companies, I have supervised over 50 scholarship students, applying DevOps/MLOps best practices and automation to develop open source solutions.

If you're a student seeking an advisor, a researcher with overlapping interests, or a practitioner looking for innovative project collaboration, I am always open to new collaborations. You can reach me at caguiar<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@unb.br.
