Hi, I'm **Gustavo Pinto**.

I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Faculty of Computing](http://www.computacao.ufpa.br/) of the [Federal University of Pará](http://www.ufpa.br/), Brazil. I do research in the broad area of software engineering. I teach programming at the BSc level. I (eventually) [blog](http://gustavopinto.org/codefather/) and do [talks](https://speakerdeck.com/gustavopinto).

I received my Ph.D. from [Federal University of Pernambuco](http://cin.ufpe.br), Brazil, under [Dr. Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor) supervision. During the academic year of 2013-2014, I was a visiting scholar at the [State University of New York](http://binghamton.edu), working with [Dr. Yu David Liu](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~davidl). My [Ph.D. thesis]((http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/thesis.pdf)) is all about software energy consumption.

From December 2015 to March 2017 I have been an Assistant Professor at the [Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Pará](http://www.ifpa.edu.br/), Brazil. Before becoming a professor, I did a Post Doc also with [Dr. Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor).

Nowadays, my broader interests include energy consumption (*e.g.*, [CACM'2017](#)), concurrent programming (*e.g.*, [OOPSLA'2014](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/oopsla2014.pdf)), human aspects of software development (*e.g.*, [SANER'2016](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/saner2016.pdf)), and mining software repositories (*e.g.*, [ICSE'2018](#)). You can see my list of [publications here](/publications). I also maintain my [cv of failure](/cv-of-failures).

Are you a [student looking for an advisor](/students)? Are you a researcher and [think that our interests overlap](/collaborators)? I'm always looking for collaboration; you can reach me at gpinto<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@ufpa.br.

<!--
During my Ph.D., I studied how parallel programming techniques, in particular, thread management constructs and thread-safe data-structures, impact energy consumption. For instance, since we are moving from 2 to 32, 64 or even 128 cores, how can we save **energy** knowing that a 32 core processor consumes more **power** than one with 2 cores? My work on this topic, which is presented in a number of [publications](/publications), is synthesized in my Ph.D. thesis, entitled "[A Refactoring Approach to Improve Energy Consumption of Parallel Software Systems](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/thesis.pdf)".

<!-- I [teach workshops](/cv.html#teaching) on data visualization and manipulation for scientists. I also develop a number of R packages. With collaborators, I'm developing packages to run fisheries stock assessment simulations with [Stock Synthesis][nefsc] software ([ss3sim]), measure ecological portfolio effects ([ecofolio]), and simulate salmon metapopulation portfolios ([metafolio]). -->
