Hi, I'm **Carla Rocha**.

I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Faculty of Software Engineer](http://fga.unb.br) of the [Federal University of Bras√≠lia](http://www.unb.br/), Brazil, and one of the coordinators of the research group [LAPPIS](https://github.com/lappis-unb). 

I (eventually) [blog](https://medium.com/@rocha.carla), do [talks](https://youtu.be/MlGYHl3Iyyg), and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbZvFMRd5NaPiqj0w4uU8RQ).

I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including DevOps, human aspects of software development, and open source software.

You can see my list of publications, along with ***all*** preprints. 

Are you a student looking for an advisor? Are you a researcher and think that our interests overlap? I'm always looking for collaborations; you can reach me at caguiar<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@unb.br.
