<h3>$ cat welcome!</h3>

<p>My name is Gustavo Pinto and I'm a full-time Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://www.cin.ufpe.br">Informatics Center</a> in the <a
href="https://www.ufpe.br">Federal University of Pernambuco</a>, Brazil, in a cooperation with the <a href="http://www.suny.edu/">State University of New York</a>, EUA. </p>

<p>I received my Master of Computer Science at the <a
href="http://www.inf.ufpr.br">Federal University of Paraná</a>, Brazil after a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the <a
href="http://www.cesupa.br">University Center of Pará</a>, Brazil.</p>

<p>Since 2008, I have been participated as speaker, moderator and reviewer in professional and academic conferences on topics related to software engineering, programming languages, and open source. You can read more about my actives in the <a href="/news" >news section</a>.</p>

<h3>$ cat research</h3>

<p>I am particularly interested in a broad spectrum of software engineering research: parallel libraries, software evolution, source code mining, refactoring tools, and open source. A common thread in my research is to understand how programmers use parallelism in their code. Based on this understanding, my research goal is to develop techniques and software tools that improve parallel programmer productivity and make parallel programming accessible to all programmers.

Another branch of research is to understand how parallel programming techniques impact on energy consumption. Since we are moving from 2 to 32, 64 or even 128 cores, how can we save energy knowing that a 32 core processor consumes more power than 2 core one?
