<h3>$ cat welcome!</h3>

<p>My name is Gustavo Pinto and I'm a full-time Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://www.cin.ufpe.br">Informatics Center</a> in the <a
href="https://www.ufpe.br">Federal University of Pernambuco</a>, Brazil, in a cooperation with the <a href="http://www.suny.edu/">State University of New York</a>, EUA. </p>

<p>I received my Master of Computer Science at the <a
href="http://www.inf.ufpr.br">Federal University of Paraná</a>, Brazil after a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the <a
href="http://www.cesupa.br">University Center of Pará</a>, Brazil.</p>

<p>Since 2008, I have been participated as speaker, moderator and reviewer in professional and academic conferences on topics related to software engineering, programming languages, and open source. You can read more about my actives in the <a href="/news" >news section</a>.</p>

<h3>$ cat research</h3>

<p>I am specifically interested in program analysis, parallel libraries, software evolution, source code mining, refactoring tools, user-centered design, and open source. A common thread in my research is understanding how programmers use parallelism in their code. Based on this understanding, my research goal is to develop techniques and software tools that improve parallel programmer productivity and make parallel programming accessible to all programmers.

Another prove of point is that I want to know how to safely move from singlecore to multicore programming, and, at the same time, improve energy consumption. In fact, I want to know how to safely move from single core to multicore programming, and, at the same time, improve energy consumption.
