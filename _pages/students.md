I am continuously looking for good people to join my research group, at all levels: undergraduate students, M.S students, Ph.D. students, Postdocs, or research programmers.

Before getting in touch, read a [list of research topics](/research) that I am interested in. This list is not exhaustive, though. Students are welcome to bring their own research topic.

### Requirements

There are some basic skills and requirements you should carefully consider before applying for a master/PhD position under my supervision. Here is some advice (in no priority order):

- learn how to use svn and git
- learn how to write in LaTeX
- learn how to use the command line
- learn how to program, preferably in some scripting and low level languages.
- read at least a couple of scientific papers in your fields of interest
- be comfortable speaking and writing in English
