The project list is divided into public datasets I created, empirical studies I conducted, and tools I developed in cooperation with colleagues and students. Under methodological aspects, you'll find an article about (ethical) issues in sampling software developers.

## Datasets

* [SOTorrent](https://github.com/sotorrent): Reconstructing and linking the version history of Stack Overflow posts

## Studies

* [Stack Overflow Code Snippets](/projects/snippets): Usage of Stack Overflow code snippets in GitHub projects
* [Sketches and Diagrams in Practice](/projects/sketches): Usage of sketches and diagrams in software engineering practice
* [Performance Debugging](/projects/debugging): How do developers locate performance bugs?
* [Sketching and Program Comprehension](/projects/sketching-experiment): Effects of sketching on program comprehension

## Methodology

* [Sampling Software Developers](/projects/sampling): Issues in sampling software developers for surveys.

## Tools

* [LivelySketches](/projects/livelysketches): Tool supporting the analog and digital lifecycle of sketches.
* [VisualCues](/projects/visualcues): Classroom presentation tool for source code.
* [SketchLink](/projects/sketchlink): Tool for linking sketches to source code artifacts.
* [RegViz](http://www.regviz.org/){:target="_blank"}: Tool that visually augments regular expressions.
