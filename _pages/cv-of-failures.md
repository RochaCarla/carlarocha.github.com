This "CV of Failures" was heavily inspired by the [CV of Failures](https://vitak.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/vitak-cv-of-failures-dec17.pdf) of [Jessica Vitak](https://jessicavitak.com/). While academia is full of failure, we only know about the success of our peers. I think people should talk more about failure. Although I just started my academic career, I have failed a lot. Some examples are in the following (this list is incomplete; some are just too old that I cannot recall).
