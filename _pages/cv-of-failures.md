This "CV of Failures" was heavily inspired by the [CV of Failures](https://vitak.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/vitak-cv-of-failures-dec17.pdf) of [Jessica Vitak](https://jessicavitak.com/). While academia is full of failure, we only know about the success of our peers. Since rejections is part of the process, I think people should talk more about failure. I'm doing my part.

I don't like rejections, but I try to see rejections as an opportunity to improve even further. Still, many rejections might also indicate that you have been working hard. As so, by 2021, ***my goal is to have 100+ rejections.***
