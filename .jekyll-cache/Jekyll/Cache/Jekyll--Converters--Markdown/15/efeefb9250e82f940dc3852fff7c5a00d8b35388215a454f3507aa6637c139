I"Ï<p>This year, an undergraduate student of mine first-authored a paper in the <a href="http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/msr2019c.pdf">MSR
challenge track</a> on the
presence of violations in JavaScript code snippets available on StackOverflow.
This blog post is an attempt to summarize all the steps taken to find a way
to send the student to attend the conference (and present his paper). Perhaps
it could help some other students to make it to ICSE.</p>
