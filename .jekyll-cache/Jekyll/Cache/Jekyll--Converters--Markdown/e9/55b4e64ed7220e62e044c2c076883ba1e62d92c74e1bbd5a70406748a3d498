He has very broad interests in Software Engineering, including Open Source Software (communities and contributors), Human Aspects of Software Engineering, Empirical Software Engineering, and Mining Software Repositories techniques. As a young researcher, he has published over 90 research papers, some of them in the most important venues in his field (e.g., ICSE, ASE, EMSE, etc). He has won seven international research and service awards including one ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper award in ICSE 2021. His research was cited over 1,500 times. He is a CNPq researcher (level 2), a scholarship only provided to exceptional Brazilian researchers. Since 2020, he has been serving as a (co-)Editor-in-Chief of the <a href="http://jserd.sbc.org.br">Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development</a>. He is also the co-host of the <a href="https://anchor.fm/FronteirasES">Frontiers in Software Engineering</a> (in PT-BR), a podcast for disseminating software engineering research. He authored two short books (one for young researchers and another one explaining open source licensing, and their hidden problems).</p>
