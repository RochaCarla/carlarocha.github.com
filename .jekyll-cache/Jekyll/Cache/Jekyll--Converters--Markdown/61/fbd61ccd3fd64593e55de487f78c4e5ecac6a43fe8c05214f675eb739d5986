I"å<p>Some days ago I made an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtGbp2HwmKA&amp;t=3s">YouTube live</a> about how to deal with rejections (in PT-BR, sorry). This blog post is a text version of that video.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most important parts of the scientific endeavour is to communicate what you found in your research study to your academic peers. This communication starts when a researcher submits a paper to an academic venue (such as, a conference or a journal). If the paper is accepted, the paper will be published in the conference/journal proceedings, and then could be accessed by anyone interested in the research topic of the paper.</p>

<p>Deciding which venue you will submit your is critical, since some venues might have better visibility and reach than other ones. Actually, although some venues might have a fancy name, they might not have a good reputation. For instance, some venues publish roughly any kind of work (regardless of the quality of the work), if they can charge you money. Young scholars should build their reputation by staying away from bad venues. But how could you
distinguish the good from the bad venue?</p>

<p>In this blog post Iâ€™m assuming that the reader is already familiar with paper writing activities, and may already have a paper in good shape for an eventual submission. The question is: how to find a good place to submit your work?</p>

<p>When deciding where to submit your paper, sometimes you could rely on your advisor or your colleagues that participated in the research if you. Since they might be more senior than you, they might some ideas of interesting places in which you could submit the work. These ideas often come from their own expertise in conducting (and submitting) scientific work. As a junior member of the time, sometime itâ€™s hard to disagree with the suggestions that your colleagues made, mainly because you might not have other suggestions (or perhaps you donâ€™t know if the places you have in mind are indeed good ones). As a consequence, you may inherit the same perception of your mentors and colleagues.</p>

<p>Although this is a very common way to build your understanding about the research paper submitting process, there are alternative ways.</p>
