I",<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Carla Rocha</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m an Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://fga.unb.br">Faculty of Software Engineer</a> of the <a href="http://www.unb.br/">Federal University of Brasília</a>, Brazil, and one of the coordinators of the research group <a href="https://www.zup.com.br/">LAPPIS</a>.</p>

<p>I (eventually) <a href="https://medium.com/@rocha.carla">blog</a>, do <a href="https://youtu.be/MlGYHl3Iyyg">talks</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbZvFMRd5NaPiqj0w4uU8RQ">videos</a>.</p>

<p>I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including DevOps, human aspects of software development, and open source software.</p>

<p>You can see my list of <a href="/publications">publications here</a>, along with <strong><em>all</em></strong> preprints.</p>

<p>Are you a <a href="/students">student looking for an advisor</a>? Are you a researcher and think that our interests overlap? I’m always looking for collaborations; you can reach me at gpinto<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@unb.br.</p>
