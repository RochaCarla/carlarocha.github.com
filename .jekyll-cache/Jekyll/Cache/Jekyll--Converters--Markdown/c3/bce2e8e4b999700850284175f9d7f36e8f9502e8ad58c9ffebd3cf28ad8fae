I"“(<p>I‚Äôve been involved in several research projects with both research groups and companies R&amp;D. I am one of many coordinators of the applied research laboratory <a href="https://lappis-unb.github.io/lappis.rocks/">LAPPIS</a>. I had the opportunity to coordinate several applied research projects with governmental agencies and private companies. I had more than 50 scholarships  under my supervision. Most of the projects I am involved in have software development under an open source license. I will present the latest projects. For the complete list, please visit my <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/2831991076751452">lattes page</a>.</p>

<p>A presentation of the latest projects, with some technical details is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ywrszF-efFiFrmqVJ8JGCpr19EHfh0M5C8ZZ8fmL8x8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>Our research focuses on empirical investigation of the organizational structure and characteristics of DevOps teams in software-producing organizations. By bringing together the expertise of three research teams, we aim to create a comprehensive understanding of this rapidly evolving field. The results of this study will provide valuable insights for organizations seeking to adopt or improve their DevOps practices, and for researchers looking to advance our understanding of this important topic.

<p>Estou escrevendo um livro!!! Coloco aqui em projetos, pois a escrita de um livro √© um super projeto em si. A ideia desse livro veio de anos de experi√™ncia aplicando t√©cnicas de aprendizagem por experi√™ncia, mentoria, onboarding em comunidades de software livre e desenvolvimento de software. A metodologia foi refinada ao longo desses ultimos 10 anos e foi aplicada com sucesso em diversos contextos. Desde disciplina de gradua√ß√£o, √† capacita√ß√£o de profissionais de TI em temas espec√≠ficos, a mentoria de mulheres e grupos subrepresentados em Software Livre, e projetos de imers√£o. Ou seja, o livro √© resultado de muita colabora√ß√£o e muitas pessoas contribuiram para amadurecimento desse conte√∫do.</p>

<p>O livro ainda est√° longe de ter uma vers√£o completa, mas voc√™ pode acess√°-lo <a href="https://rochacarla.github.io/Onboarding/">aqui</a> e colaborar!</p>

<p>I am the project coordinator for the ‚ÄúResid√™ncia em TIC da BRISA - UnB FGA‚Äù project. BRISA - Society for the Development of Information Technology - has partnered with the University of Bras√≠lia campus Gama and LAPPIS to provide training for students from technology, undergraduate, and technical education courses, to become developers of systems using the latest information technology and communications technologies. The residency program features an immersion stage, where I lead 40 students in developing projects with companies, using active learning methods.</p>

<p>The BRISA project is supported by the Information Technology Law through the Priority Program of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation - MCTI, coordinated by Softex.</p>

<h2 id="big-open-source-siblings-boss---2020---ongoing">Big Open Source Siblings (BOSS) - 2020 - ongoing</h2>

<p>The BOSS initiative is designed to empower underrepresented groups in the tech industry to learn and contribute to open source projects. With a focus on mentorship, the program provides a supportive environment where participants can develop the necessary skills and confidence to work on projects. The mentoring process includes hands-on experience in a safe and inclusive space, covering both the technical aspects of open source as well as personal challenges such as intersectionality and impostor syndrome.</p>

<p>At the end of the program, participants will have a solid foundation of knowledge and experience that they can use to pursue further contributions to open source projects. The BOSS initiative is committed to fostering diversity and inclusivity in the tech community, providing a platform for individuals from underrepresented groups to build their skills and advance their careers.</p>

<p>This project is focused on using machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies and outliers in large customer datasets. The goal is to improve the accuracy of these detections and make the process more efficient through the use of data, feature engineering, and MLOps techniques and practices.</p>

<p>By following a commonly used machine learning workflow and incorporating DevOps and MLOps best practices, the project aims to increase the speed of experimentation and scalability of the process to other databases and teams. The focus on including DevOps and MLOps practices helps ensure that the project remains efficient, automated, and streamlined throughout the entire process.</p>

<h2 id="chatbot-to-guide-the-submission-of-culture-incentive-proposal---ministry-of-culture---2017-2019">Chatbot to guide the submission of Culture Incentive proposal - Ministry of Culture - 2017-2019</h2>

<p>In this project, we developed one of the first chatbots for brazilian government. We developed an open source chatbot solution, with over 70 intentions to answer about the Culture Incentive Law to guide cultural agents in proposing their project.</p>

<p>We innovate in chatbot architecture, continuous deploy pipeline, and we used MLOps practices and techniques before the term was coined by practitioners.</p>

<p>The entire project is available on the github organization of <a href="https://github.com/lappis-unb">LAPPIS</a>.</p>

<p>We also developed an Open Source  <a href="https://github.com/lappis-unb/rasa-ptbr-boilerplate">Chatbot Boilerplate</a>, with all the functionalities needed for a chatbot product, to guide newcomers into this growing industry. The community has more than 350 participants on the communication channel.</p>

<h2 id="public-money-public-code--modernising-public-infrastructure-with-free-software">Public Money Public Code ‚Äì Modernising Public Infrastructure with Free Software</h2>

<p>The LAPPIS team translated to Brazilian Portuguese the publication  ‚ÄúPublic Money Public Code ‚Äì Modernising Public Infrastructure with Free Software‚Äù from Free Software Foundation Europe.</p>

<p>The translation in portuguese is intended to raise awareness about the benefits of using free software in public infrastructure, especially in the context of Brazilian government. The publication advocates for the use of free software in public institutions to increase transparency, efficiency, and security of IT systems, and to ensure that the public funds are spent on IT solutions that are accessible and controlled by the public itself. By translating the publication, the LAPPIS team aims to contribute to the discussion and promote the use of free software in the Brazilian government.</p>
