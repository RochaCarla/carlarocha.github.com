I"2<p>Iâ€™ve been involved in several research projects with both research groups and companies R&amp;D. I am one of many coordinators of the applied research laboratory <a href="https://github.com/lappis-unb">LAPPIS</a>. I had the opportunity to coordinate several applied research projects with governmental agencies and private companies. I had more than 50 scholarships  under my supervision. Most of the projects I am involved in have software development under an open source license. I will present the latest projects.

<p>The BOSS initiative aims to reach underrepresented groups in tech who want to be mentored and assisted to learn how to work on open source projects. We will provide a safe space and an accompanying methodology for them to learn basic concepts of working in a small open source project in practice and build enough background for them to, at the end of the program, be able to choose other projects to continue their contributions. The mentoring process helps build confidence, fill in technical gaps, and engage the participants.</p>

<p>In the BOSS program, besides the technical aspects of introducing newcomers to open source, we deal with some challenges to inclusion, namely, intersectionality and impostor syndrome.

<p>We won the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/challenge/winners/">Gnome Community Engagement Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>In this project, we experiment with several machine learning algorithms to detect outliers and anomalies in large Customer Dataset. We deploy Data, Feature Engineering, and MLOps techniques and practices.</p>

<h2 id="chatbot-to-guide-the-submission-of-culture-incentive-proposal---ministry-of-culture---2017-2019">Chatbot to guide the submission of Culture Incentive proposal - Ministry of Culture - 2017-2019</h2>

<p>In this project, we developed one of the first chatbots for brazilian government. We developed an open source chatbot solution, with over 70 intentions to answer about the Culture Incentive Law to guide cultural agents in proposing their project.</p>

<p>We innovate in chatbot architecture, continuous deploy pipeline, and we used MLOps practices and techniques before the term was coined by practitioners.</p>

<p>The entire project is available on the github organization of <a href="https://github.com/lappis-unb">LAPPIS</a>.</p>
