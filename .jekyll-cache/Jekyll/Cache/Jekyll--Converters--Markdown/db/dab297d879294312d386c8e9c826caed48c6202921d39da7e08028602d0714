I"P<p><strong>Carla Rocha</strong>.</p>

<p>I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://fga.unb.br">Faculty of Software Engineer</a> at the <a href="http://www.unb.br/">University of Brasília (UnB)</a>, where I also serve as one of the coordinators of the <a href="https://lappis-unb.github.io/lappis.rocks/">LAPPIS</a> research group. I have a diverse range of interests in Software Engineering, including DevOps, Agile, human aspects of software development, Machine Learning, and Open Source software.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am a co-founder of the Big Open Source Siblings(<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bAOZ0gLjEIwOLhkRhakvaXG1_FP4fGuHYMVhEc72w7M/edit?usp=sharing">BOSS</a>), a mentorship program aimed at introducing underrepresented groups to Open Source contribution. Through my research projects in collaboration with government agencies and private companies, I have supervised over 50 scholarship students, applying DevOps/MLOps best practices and automation to develop open source solutions.</p>

<p>If you’re a student seeking an advisor, a researcher with overlapping interests, or a practitioner looking for innovative project collaboration, I am always open to new collaborations. You can reach me at caguiar<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@unb.br.</p>
