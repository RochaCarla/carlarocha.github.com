I"><p>Over the last few years, I became more and more into creating good figures to use in research papers. It probably started when I was reading a book about <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do">data science</a> in the mid of my phd. Back then I start to learn about matplotlib for Python and ggplot for R. I was somehow impressed by the quality of these figures and the reasonably low effort required to create them. I also remember that I convinced myself to update all figures of a <a href="http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/jss_2015.pdf">30+ pages paper</a> that we have been working on for, at least, <a href="http://fernandocastor.github.io/general/2016/10/11/long-hard-road.html">3 years</a>. Needless to say that I was very proud about the new figures on the paper (and its eventual acceptance).</p>
