I"˜<p>Iâ€™m working on two books.</p>

<p>The <a href="/books/good-rearch-habits/">first one</a> is a short book describing some good habits that I think are valuable for young researchers trying to find their way in academia. <a href="/books/good-rearch-habits/">For the first 90 days, I donated 100% of the sales to a hospital.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://gum.co/oss-licensing-101">second book</a> aims to ease the understanding of open source software licenses.</p>

<p>Both of them are self-published on gumroad.</p>
