This communication starts when a researcher submits a paper to an academic venue (such as, a conference or a journal). If the paper is accepted, the paper will be published in the conference/journal proceedings, and then could be accessed by anyone interested in the research topic of the paper.

<p>Sometimes your advisor or your colleagues that participated with you in the research already have some ideas of interesting places in which you could submit the work. These ideas often come from their own expertise in conducting (and submitting) scientific work. As a junior member of the time, sometime itâ€™s hard to disagree with the suggestions that your colleagues made, mainly because you might not have other suggestions (or perhaps you donâ€™t know if the places you have in mind are indeed good ones). As a consequence, you may inherit the same perception of your mentors and colleagues.</p>
