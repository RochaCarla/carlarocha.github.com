I"÷<p>Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Carla Rocha</strong>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://fga.unb.br">Faculty of Software Engineer</a> of the <a href="http://www.unb.br/">University of BrasÃ­lia (UnB)</a>, Brazil, and one of the coordinators of the research group <a href="https://lappis-unb.github.io/lappis.rocks/">LAPPIS</a>.</p>

<p>I am also one of the founders of the Big Open Source Siblings (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bAOZ0gLjEIwOLhkRhakvaXG1_FP4fGuHYMVhEc72w7M/edit?usp=sharing">BOSS</a>), a mentorship program to introduce underrepresented groups to contribute to Open Source.</p>

<p>I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including DevOps, Agile, human aspects of software development, and open source software. I have coordinated several applied research projects in collaboration with both government agencies and private companies. In these projects, I coordinate the development of open source solutions, applying DevOps/MLOps best practices/automation, and innovative experiments. I had more than 50 scholarship students under my supervision participating in these projects.</p>

<p>You can see my list of publications, along with <strong><em>all</em></strong> preprints.</p>

<p>Are you a student looking for an advisor? Are you a researcher and think that our interests overlap? Iâ€™m always looking for collaborations; you can reach me at caguiar<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@unb.br.</p>
