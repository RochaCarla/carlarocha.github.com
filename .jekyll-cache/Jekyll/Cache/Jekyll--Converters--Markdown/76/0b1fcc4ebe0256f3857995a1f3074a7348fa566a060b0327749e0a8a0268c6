I"¡<p>I‚Äôve been involved in several research projects with both research groups and companies R&amp;D. I am one of many coordinators of the applied research laboratory <a href="https://lappis-unb.github.io/lappis.rocks/">LAPPIS</a>. I had the opportunity to coordinate several applied research projects with governmental agencies and private companies. I had more than 50 scholarships  under my supervision. Most of the projects I am involved in have software development under an open source license. I will present the latest projects. For the complete list, please visit my <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/2831991076751452">lattes page</a>.</p>

<p>A presentation of the latest projects, with some technical details is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ywrszF-efFiFrmqVJ8JGCpr19EHfh0M5C8ZZ8fmL8x8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>This work presents empirical research on the structure of DevOps teams in software-producing organizations. The goal is to better understand the organizational structure and characteristics of teams adopting DevOps by harmonizing the existing knowledge. Three research teams have gathered to perform this research.</p>

<h2 id="hygia---2023---ongoing">Hygia - 2023 - ongoing</h2>

<p>Hygia is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data pipeline configuration through a YAML file to make working with Machine Learning data easy and intuitive. It consists of helping developers and users to register, organize, compare and share all their ML model metadata in a single place, facilitating the generation of requirements in the ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process. Thus, the migration can be scaled, automated, and accelerated for similar contexts.</p>

<p>Coordenadora do projeto ‚ÄúResid√™ncia em TIC da BRISA - UnB FGA‚Äù. A BRISA Sociedade para o Desenvolvimento da Tecnologia da Informa√ß√£o, em parceria com a UnB campus Gama e LAPPIS, vai capacitar estudantes de cursos de tecnologias, gradua√ß√£o e ensino t√©cnico, para se tornarem desenvolvedores de sistemas nas tecnologias mais atuais de inform√°tica e comunica√ß√µes. A resid√™ncia conta com uma etapa de imers√£o, no qual coordeno 40 alunos desenvolvendo projetos junto √† empresas, usando m√©todos de aprendizado ativo.
A BRISA conta com recursos da Lei de Inform√°tica, atrav√©s de Programa Priorit√°rio do Minist√©rio da Ci√™ncia, Tecnologia e inova√ß√µes ‚Äì MCTI, coordenado pela Softex.</p>

<h2 id="big-open-source-siblings-boss---2020---ongoing">Big Open Source Siblings (BOSS) - 2020 - ongoing</h2>

<p>The BOSS initiative aims to reach underrepresented groups in tech who want to be mentored and assisted to learn how to work on open source projects. We will provide a safe space and an accompanying methodology for them to learn basic concepts of working in a small open source project in practice and build enough background for them to, at the end of the program, be able to choose other projects to continue their contributions. The mentoring process helps build confidence, fill in technical gaps, and engage the participants.</p>

<p>In the BOSS program, besides the technical aspects of introducing newcomers to open source, we deal with some challenges to inclusion, namely, intersectionality and impostor syndrome.

<h2 id="machine-learning-for-outlier-detection-in-customer-databases---partnership-with-the-instituto-eldoradodell---2021---ongoing">Machine Learning for outlier detection in Customer databases - partnership with the Instituto Eldorado/Dell - 2021 - ongoing</h2>

<p>In this project, we experiment with several machine learning algorithms to detect outliers and anomalies in large Customer Dataset. We deploy Data, Feature Engineering, and MLOps techniques and practices.</p>

<p>We adopted a commonly used machine learning workflow depicted in various forms across industry and research. It has commonalities with prior workflows defined in data science and data mining, such as TDSP, KDD, and CRISP-DM. They have in common the data-centered essence of the process and the multiple feedback loops among the different stages. We followed some DevOps and MLOps best practices and automation to speed up the experimentation cycle and scale the process to other databases and a larger team.</p>

<p>In this project, we developed one of the first chatbots for brazilian government. We developed an open source chatbot solution, with over 70 intentions to answer about the Culture Incentive Law to guide cultural agents in proposing their project.</p>

<p>We innovate in chatbot architecture, continuous deploy pipeline, and we used MLOps practices and techniques before the term was coined by practitioners.</p>

<p>The entire project is available on the github organization of <a href="https://github.com/lappis-unb">LAPPIS</a>.</p>

<p>We also developed an Open Source  <a href="https://github.com/lappis-unb/rasa-ptbr-boilerplate">Chatbot Boilerplate</a>, with all the functionalities needed for a chatbot product, to guide newcomers into this growing industry. The community has more than 350 participants on the communication channel.</p>
