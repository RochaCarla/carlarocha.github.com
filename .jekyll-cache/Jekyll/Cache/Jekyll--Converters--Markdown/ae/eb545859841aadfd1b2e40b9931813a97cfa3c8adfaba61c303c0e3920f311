<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Gustavo Pinto</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m an Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://www.computacao.ufpa.br/">Faculty of Computing</a> of the <a href="http://www.ufpa.br/">Federal University of Pará</a>, Brazil. I do research in the broad area of software engineering. I teach programming at the BSc level. I (eventually) <a href="http://gustavopinto.org/blog/">blog</a>, do <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/gustavopinto">talks</a>, and <a href="http://gustavopinto.org/vlogs/">videos</a>. I am also active on <a href="http://twitter.com/gustavopinto/">twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently the (co-)Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development (<a href="https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jserd/">JSERD</a>).</p>

<p>I received my Ph.D. from <a href="http://cin.ufpe.br">Federal University of Pernambuco</a>, Brazil, under <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor">Dr. Fernando Castor</a> supervision. During the academic year of 2013-2014, I was a visiting scholar at the <a href="http://binghamton.edu">State University of New York</a>, working with <a href="http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~davidl">Dr. Yu David Liu</a>. My <a href="http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/thesis.pdf">Ph.D. thesis</a> was all about software energy consumption. I wrote a summary of my PhD thesis <a href="/phd-summary">here</a>.</p>

<!-- From December 2015 to March 2017 I have been an Assistant Professor at the [Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Pará](http://www.ifpa.edu.br/), Brazil. Before becoming a professor, I did a Post Doc also with [Dr. Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor).-->

<p>I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including refactoring (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href="http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/jss2019b.pdf">JSS’2019</a>), human aspects of software development (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href="http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse2018.pdf">ICSE’2018</a>), and open source software (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href="http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse-seet2019.pdf">ICSE-SEET’2019</a>).</p>

<p>You can see my list of <a href="/publications">publications here</a>, along with <strong><em>all</em></strong> preprints. I also maintain my <a href="/cv-of-failures">cv of failure</a>.</p>

<p>Are you a <a href="/students">student looking for an advisor</a>? Are you a researcher and think that our interests overlap? I’m always looking for collaborations; you can reach me at gpinto<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@ufpa.br.</p>
