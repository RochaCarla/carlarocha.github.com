I"©<p><a href="http://gum.co/good-research-habits">Iâ€™m selling about good habits that young scholars could foster while finding their path in academia, for only $ 5</a>.</p>

<p>During the first 90 days, 100% of the sales will go to <a href="https://coronavirus.ufpa.br/doacoes">UFPA hospitals fighting COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>To make things transparent, in this webpage I will make available the summary of the sales and the donations made.</p>

<p>I will update this website every week. I start selling the book on April, 26th.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Gumroad only transfers to Paypal if you have at least 10 USD in your account (after fees). This week I had two sales so, after fees, I hadnâ€™t enough to be transferred. The amount of sales received in the second week will be payed in the third week. However, I received three payments from someone who wasnâ€™t able to buy through gumroad (I received two transfers in my personal account in this case).</p>
