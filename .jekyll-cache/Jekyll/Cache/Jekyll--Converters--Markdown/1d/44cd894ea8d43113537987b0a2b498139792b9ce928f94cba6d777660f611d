I"ú<p>Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Carla Rocha</strong>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://fga.unb.br">Faculty of Software Engineer</a> of the <a href="http://www.unb.br/">Federal University of BrasÃ­lia</a>, Brazil, and one of the coordinators of the research group <a href="https://github.com/lappis-unb">LAPPIS</a>.</p>

<p>I (eventually) <a href="https://medium.com/@rocha.carla">blog</a>, do <a href="https://youtu.be/MlGYHl3Iyyg">talks</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbZvFMRd5NaPiqj0w4uU8RQ">videos</a>.</p>

<p>I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including DevOps, human aspects of software development, and open source software.</p>

<p>You can see my list of publications, along with <strong><em>all</em></strong> preprints.</p>

<p>Are you a student looking for an advisor? Are you a researcher and think that our interests overlap? Iâ€™m always looking for collaborations; you can reach me at caguiar<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@unb.br.</p>
