I"j<p>I have been reflecting on the roles that I took in academia over these last 10+
years and I finally decided to write them down. I believe I have passed through at
least four different roles in the academic system. These roles are informal and
they only exist in my mind. I may have spent 3â€“4 years in
each role. The roles follow a very sequential process: you only pass to the
next one when you pretty much understand the current one. Interestingly, there
is no one that says that you should pass thought all these roles, in this order.
They just happen to happen to be like this. At least it happened to me.</p>
