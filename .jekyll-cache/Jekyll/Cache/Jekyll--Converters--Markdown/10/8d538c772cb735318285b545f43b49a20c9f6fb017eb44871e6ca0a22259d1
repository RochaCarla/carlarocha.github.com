I")<p>While Iâ€™m starting my second year of Assistant professor, it is worth to look
back and see how was my first year. It may help to improve my professoring
skills or maybe help someone else who is just about to start his academic
career. In numbers, last year I taught five courses (all of them new to me),
supervised tree urop students, and co-supervised tree masters student and one
phd student. In terms of service, I reviewed 12 papers to four conferences and
journals. I also published nine research papers and submitted two research grants.</p>
