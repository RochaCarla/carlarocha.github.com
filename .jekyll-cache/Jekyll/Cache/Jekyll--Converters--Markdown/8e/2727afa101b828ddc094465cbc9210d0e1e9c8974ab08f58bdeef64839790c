<h2 id="gettting-in-touch">Gettting in touch</h2>

<p>Before getting in touch, however, read a <a href="/research">list of research topics</a> that I am interested in. This list is not exhaustive, though. Students are welcome to bring their own research topic. However, please keep in mind that I will be more happy to work on stuff which happen to be on my <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/critical-path.htm">critical path</a>. When getting in touch, please state which research topic are you interested in.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: if you have little to no research experience, listen to <a href="https://hipsters.tech/pesquisa-em-engenharia-de-software-hipsters-84/">this podcast</a>.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>There are some basic skills and requirements you should carefully consider before applying for a urop/master/PhD position under my supervision.</p>

<p>The most important skill is <strong><em>responsiveness</em></strong>. From Monday to Friday, I’d expect that any email should be answered reasonable quickly.</p>

<p>What does this mean?</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I’d expect one email to be answered in at most 24 hours during the weekdays (even if the answer is: ‘‘I got your message, I will do that later’’). However, I also understand that there are periods of low responsiveness (e.g., when taking exams, traveling, attending a conference, sick, etc). In most of these cases, the period of unresponsiveness is clear in advance (e.g., you know when you have to travel), so please let me know in advance as well! I also understand very exceptional situations, but, say, two weeks of unresponsiveness may suggest you have been busy with many other things other than research.</p>

<p>I usually do not care if you work in the morning or in the evening, but I do care about responsiveness. If you do not use <strong>any</strong> communication channel frequently (e.g., at least once a day), please <strong><em>do not apply</em></strong> for any position under my supervision.</p>

<p>There are some also additional important skills (in no priority order):</p>

<ul>
  <li>learn how to use git</li>
  <li>learn how to write in LaTeX</li>
  <li>learn how to use the command line</li>
  <li>learn how to program, preferably in some scripting programming languages.</li>
  <li>read at least a couple of scientific papers</li>
  <li>be comfortable with reading and writing in English</li>
</ul>

<p>If you still want to apply, <strong>I strongly recommend you</strong> to talk with some of my previous students (a list of former and current students is available <a href="/students">here</a>).</p>

<p>If you are already a master student, read <a href="/instrucoes-alunos-msc">this</a> (pt-br).</p>
