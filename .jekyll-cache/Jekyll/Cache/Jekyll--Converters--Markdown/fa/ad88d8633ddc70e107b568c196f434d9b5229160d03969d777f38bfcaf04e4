I"<p>I write mostly about academic life. <br /></p>

<p><strong>Important note</strong>: these posts might have typos or weird wording. Although I might be aware of some of these issues, I do not plan to fix any of them. This is because writing takes time. If I want my blog posts to be free of typos, I might ended up not publishing anything, because I may need to polish them a lot (since Iâ€™m not a native English speaker, this takes even more time). So, I decided not to polish these blog posts in order to give them existence.<br /></p>
