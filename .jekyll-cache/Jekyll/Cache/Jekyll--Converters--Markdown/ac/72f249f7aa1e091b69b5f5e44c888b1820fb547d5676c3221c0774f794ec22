I"é<p>Although I am a professor, teaching is not the part of my work that I love the
most. I do like teaching, but I do not love teaching. And when I have a heavy
teaching working, I tend to enjoy it even less. Some reasons because teaching is
just OK to me: teaching (preparing material, teaching itself, grading, etc)
takes a lot of time; we have little to no feedback (students rarely comment if
the class was amazing or terrible); students are not always
engaged with the class, etc.</p>
