you won't it if it's not easy to revise

and revising lots and lots of times is critical to optimal data presentation

data visualization (and analysis in general) needs to be fast to iterate on

That's a problem with using base plot for data exploration

That's also a problem with using graphical user interfaces, such as Inkscape or Illustrator, for designs that will require lots of tweaking

It's initially easier to do it in Inkscape but with more revisions, scripted becomes faster. Draw a graph of that. It's a matter of figuring out where on the graph you are and picking the right tool. Hint: at least 90% of the time it's scripted.

this also points to the need to (1) get really familiar with plotting functions or (2) find somebody to work with who is already.
