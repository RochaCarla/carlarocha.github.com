title: Succeeding inspite of not because of
---

I often wonder

Working in Word vs. LaTeX.

Not worrying about the details of an analysis.

Presenting methods in a highly technical way.

Do I succeed because of the people I worked with on a certain project or inspite of them.

Do I success because I work crazy and odd hours or inspite of.

It's easy to gloss over it in your head and convince yourself of whatever you'd like.

Can have a similarity to superstition. E.g., 

# Learning from others
It's easy to look at others and learn the wrong lesson.

People have complex personalities and strengths and weaknesses when it comes to research. 

Easy to emulate the wrong traits. E.g. Big Name Professor X might have succeeded *inspite* his confrontational personality.
